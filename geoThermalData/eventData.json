        "summary": "TRANSFORMING POSSIBILITIES INTO REALITIES AI now stands as a pivotal game-changing technology that impacts us all. Recent breakthroughs in AI have sparked renewed interest in its potential, risks, and implications for humanity. While AI has primarily been about pattern recognition, future advancements will bring systems with human-level cognitive abilities, fundamentally reshaping our way of life with profound implications for societies everywhere PM Lawrence Wong Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a future concept, but rather a present-day reality that is transforming industries and society throughout the globe. Singapore, with its forward-thinking policies and strategic initiatives, is leading the way in this shift. AI is crucial for Singapores ambitions, enhancing efficiency, innovation and competitiveness. Singapore's push for innovation relies on its capacity to leverage data. AI's ability to analyse vast datasets yields valuable insights, driving the development of new products and services. This data-driven approach not only creates new business opportunities but also improves customer experiences. Agility and vision are essential for staying competitive in a globalised economy. AI gives Singaporean businesses the predictive power to improve supply chains, streamline decision-making procedures, and predict market trends with unique precision. By taking a proactive stance, organisations can stay ahead of the curve and quickly adjust to changing market conditions. AI's importance extends beyond economic gains to advancing sustainable development goals. It optimises energy utilisation and lowers waste by deploying resource-efficient apps, resulting in much lower environmental footprints. Smart grids and AI-driven logistics are great examples of how simplified processes may increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. This emphasises AI's critical role in creating a more sustainable future for the entire world. Singapore's commitment to AI is demonstrated by strong government support and forward-thinking policies. The new National AI Strategy and Model AI Governance Framework provide a comprehensive framework for ethical AI development. This enabling ecosystem promotes responsible innovation and ensures that AI deployment is consistent with ethical standards and societal well-being. As attendees gather at the AI Summit, Singapore's AI journey unfolds, demonstrating the country's steadfast commitment to leveraging technology for societal advancement. Singapore lays the groundwork for a future where AI acts as an accelerator for equitable growth and global leadership by enhancing efficiency, fostering innovation, boosting competitiveness, promoting sustainability, and empowering its workforce. The Singapore Gen AI Revolution Summit 2024 brings together industry leaders, innovators, and visionaries from the enterprise, finance, and public sectors to explore the newest AI developments and applications.",

        "summary": "What You'll Do Born and raised in Bangkok, Sirilaksana, or Siri, will be preparing a special meal in memory of her late mother, who served in the Royal Thai Air Force. Weekends were precious moments for them to spend together, and they were often filled with delicious food. This dinner, Siri will recreate a dish particularly dear to them a seafood stir-fried noodle dish called radna. The freshness of the seafood in Chon Buri, a destination for this dish, is a key part of the memory that she hopes to share with everyone. About Whats For My Dinner In moments of remembrance, food becomes a heartfelt tribute to our departed loved ones. This year, join us as we witness the preparation of these special meals and learn about the connection between food and the departed from communities from different cultures, nationalities and background. Multiculturalism is important in Singapore as it serves as the bedrock of the nation's societal fabric. It fosters mutual respect and harmony among diverse ethnic communities with different cultural practices, languages and religions. This shared understanding bridges social divides, cultivating an environment where every individual feels valued and included. It shapes Singapore's unique identity on the global stage, fortifying its reputation as a cosmopolitan hub. Food serves as a conduit for understanding and appreciating our neighbours culture and traditions. From Singaporean food to ASEAN cuisine to far beyond, there are dishes sure to suit everyones tastebuds. Through interacting with members from different communities, Whats For My Dinner aims to inculcate a greater awareness of the diverse communities residing in Singapore. It spotlights Singapore, through many of its culinary adaptions, as a melting pot of cultures and encourages deeper appreciation of our multicultural identity. Be inspired by the flavours and friendships and let us makan (dine)! About The Host Singapore became Sirilaksana, or Siris, new home in 2013. Drawn to the citys vibrant energy, she built a career in advertising and consumer research, and even met her husband here. Siri has been actively involved in the Thai Association for the past two years, organising their annual Songkran celebrations and community get-togethers. These experiences have led her to forge deep friendships and her desire to share the richness of Thai culture with Singapore. Who should come? Everyone is welcome to participate!

A talk moderated by Shannon Holden. About the speakers Nala | Jill Lee Okkers After Natasha, Jill is the face behind the flavours of our brands. She has worked tirelessly with her team to create dishes that are original, authentic and fresh and does so while minimising our environmental footprint in every way possible. Jills role extends into training, kitchen layout and staff structure as well as quality control on our concept brands. Shes an innovator, ensuring that were always one step ahead. Like Natasha, Jill grew up drawing inspiration in the kitchen from her grandfather and came to TG having worked in hospitality for over fifteen years, holding positions such as Head Chef, Private Chef and Development Chef with a Diploma in Culinary Arts. Jill travels extensively for research into global cuisine and is often found dipping into cookbooks and websites and keeping an eye on food trends to inform her dishes. Shes also a qualified journalist, penning her thoughts on all things culinary over on her blog Food By Jill. Shes an advocate for food sustainability, underscoring the need to reconsider how and where we source our ingredients from. Faisal Yabroudi I began my journey in the food and beverage industry in late 2015 by co-founding PINZA. Initially focusing on the food delivery segment and later on launched the PINZA B2B model to supply other F&B operators in the market. My venture expanded to launch several successful virtual delivery concepts along the way. Driven by a passion for creating & developing unique dining experiences in Dubai, I eventually transitioned into the premium casual dining sector a few years ago by co-founding an outdoor live fire cuisine concept called Fiya and eventually launching Kokoro earlier this year. We provide a simple and casual dining experience, prioritising exceptional food quality, customer service, and customer retention.\" Rahul Reddy Rahul Reddy is the founder of Subko Specialty Coffee Roasters. With Subko, Rahul intends to help reimagine the Indian Subcontinent as a legitimate contributor to the global specialty coffee movements. The conception of Subko began in December 2018, and cemented itself in February, 2019, when Rahul decided to leave behind careers in the technology, social enterprise, and risk analyst worlds to train as an apprentice at a specialty coffee company called City of Saints in Brooklyn, New York. There, he learned the art of profile roasting coffee as a roasting apprentice, learned specialty brewing, packaging, producing cold brew, and farm level green bean buying. He also completed what is considered the coffee worlds most rigorous sommelier certification, requiring him to pass 21 sensory analysis exams around coffee, called the Specialty Arabica Q Grader. Talk m oderated by Shannon Holden Shannon is the Community Relations Manager at Alserkal Avenue, with professional experience at arts and cultural institutions and corporate business environments. She holds a BA degree from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. In 2011, she managed the region's first and most extensive exhibition on contemporary African art titled As It Is!

Possessing the miraculous ability to cleanse and purify so thoroughly as it works on the physical body, emotional body, the mind and the spirit. With over 15 years of experience walking the spiritual warriors path, and over 10 years of experience working with kambo, rappe and Sananga, Iwan Bran is a medicine carrier and shaman of the land. Initiatied into many traditions, including the 1500 year old Mexican Tol lineage of the Toltec tradition of the nagual; the Peruvian Mestizo tradition; and the Bwiti tradition of Gabon. He is also a sacred fire keeper and Eagle sun dancer, and Canuppa (sacred pipe) carrier within the Lakota tradition, and walks the arduous path of the Heyoka medicine man within that tradition. He has practiced on 4 continents, and is based in his homeland of Wales, where his knowledge is rooted through his alliances with the native trees such as the Yew, Oak, Birch. His speciality is in treating trauma and addiction as well as in facilitating extractions. And he has a very soft, but direct approach, preferring mostly to work in silence. Highly recommended. Kambo is a medicine traditionally used by many Amazonian tribes to cleanse the mind, body and spirit! It systematically cleanses the liver and lymphatic system; boosts the immune system; removes any blockages; helps to put us in touch with our authentic selves; brings unresolved traumas to the surface to be released; helps us to let go of unhealthy patterns and addictions; heightens our intuition and vision; restores vitality; boosts our energy levels and helps increase motivation; makes way for the blossoming of our full potential. Kambo is a secretion that is collected from the back of the Monkey Tree Frog. After drinking 2 litres of water, a thin piece of vine is heated with a flame, then small openings are burned into the skin - usually on the arms or legs... then the kambo is applied to those tiny openings. The sensation itself is like a fiery heat.... with an increase in heart-rate and slight swelling around the lips and cheeks. All impurities and 'old' energies are usually purged by vomiting into a bucket, but sweating, crying and also needing to go to the toilet are very common ways of releasing these negative influences and heavy energies. The experience itself lasts for around 20 to 30 minutes, and is followed by a resting and rehydrating period of up to 2 hours, depending on each individual's needs. 120. Max 10 places.

Now, it's time to turn that knowledge into action. What You Can Expect: To kick things off, we are running a free community event on 30th October in the Stanton Hall, led by Hannah Leatherland from Cheltenham Borough Council, Trish and Mark Barber from Clean Air Cheltenham, and Peter Frings, which will revisit key data on air quality in Charlton Kings and outline actionable steps we can take together to improve it. Get Involved: This is more than just a discussionit's a call to action. With the launch of the \"Charlton Kings Clean Air Action Group,\" with the support of our community we want to make tangible improvements in air quality.

        "summary": "Wholeheartedly You Full Moon Womens Circles are an opportunity to pause and reconnect - a safe and sacred space to gather with other women, find grounding, comfort, inspiration and acceptance, and remember and celebrate our unity with nature and the universe. If you are feeling called to explore this interconnectivity to support your growth, healing and wellbeing, these circles are for you. The full moon is a magical moment in the already magical lunar cycle. Representing the cycles completion, the sun and moon become aligned on opposite sides of the earth and 100% of the moons face is illuminated by the sun, from our perspective at least. When you consider the magic and mystery of the universe, this is just one of many awe-inspiring wonders which can easily pass by unnoticed unless we tune in. The beauty is that as we explore our interconnectivity with nature and the moon, we can get to know ourselves more deeply. The full moon can light the way back to our truest, most wholehearted self. The significance of the full moon The energy of the full moon is that of celebration and gratitude. Sometimes in life, it can be as if we are always trying to get somewhere, so much so that we forget to pause and celebrate exactly where we are and who we are in this very moment. The full moon reminds us of our perfect wholeness. No matter what we go through, how broken we feel, or how we see ourselves, we are always whole, worthy, and complete. We are always enough. Just like the moon is always whole, it's simply that we only see it to be so at a certain point in the lunar cycle. But just because you dont see its wholeness, doesnt mean it isnt so. The full moon is an invitation to gaze up into the sky and see our perfect wholeness mirrored back to us. Energetically, the full moon can be a time when emotions and feelings are heightened. Full moon circles are also therefore an opportunity for self-reflection, to explore whatever is coming up for us at the time, with a gentle and compassionate heart. What is the full moon asking us to see? The full moon can shine the light on our lives and all parts of ourselves we keep in the shadows including our patterns and beliefs - an opportunity to turn our attention inwards and bring these parts of ourselves into the light, to embrace them wholeheartedly. What you can expect A guided meditation to relax, release tension, and connect with your heart and the energy of the full moon Gentle somatic practices to connect body and mind to support healing Reflection time and journalling with soothing natural tea The opportunity to share whatever is arising for you in our sharing circle (sharing optional) Calling on the oracle cards to connect with the moon's energy (also a beautiful way to nurture and tune into your intuition) Candlelight intention setting ritual - once the full moon reaches its peak, it begins to wane back to the new moon. What are you ready to release or let go of that no longer serves you? Please bring a crystal or piece of jewellery to place in the circle altar, to charge it with the full moons energy and the energy from the evening. Secure your place Full Moon Women's Circles are on a donation basis. I have included a suggested amount of 25 per place at the link below however please do not be put off if you cannot make a donation at this level. Please get in touch: katie@wholeheartedlyyou.co.uk. Inclusivity Wholeheartedly You Womens Circles embody inclusivity, non-judgment, and non-discrimination. Circles are therefore open to all who identify as a woman, and women from all walks of life, race, religion and background are welcome.",

Event Details: Date: January 11, 2025 Time: 15:00 - 17:00 hours Location: Thames Barn Centre , Church Rd, Thame OX9 3AJ ( Room : Small Barn) Dear Soul Family, As the New Year dawns, we are presented with a powerful opportunity to set intentions that will guide us through the year ahead. Join us for a sacred afternoon of intention setting, cacao ceremony, and shamanic drumminga transformative experience designed to help you align with your highest self and manifest your deepest desires for 2025. Why Conscious Intentions? Setting conscious intentions is more than just making resolutions; it's about connecting deeply with your inner truth and aligning your goals with the highest vision for your life. Conscious intentions are the seeds we plant in the fertile soil of our awareness, allowing us to live with purpose, clarity, and mindfulness. By setting these intentions in a sacred space, we amplify their power, inviting the universe to support our journey throughout the year. The Power of Cacao Cacao, often referred to as the \"Food of the Gods,\" has been used in ceremonial practices for centuries. This sacred plant medicine is known for its heart-opening properties, helping us to connect with our emotions, deepen our meditation, and access a higher state of consciousness. The gentle yet powerful energy of cacao allows us to clear blockages, release what no longer serves us, and invite love and compassion into our lives. It is the perfect ally in setting intentions that are rooted in love, harmony, and spiritual alignment. Shamanic Drumming: Journey into the Heart Shamanic drumming is an ancient practice that connects us with the rhythm of the earth and the heartbeat of all creation. The deep, resonant beat of the drum guides us into a meditative state, where we can journey inward to access wisdom, healing, and insight. This practice helps us to release stagnant energy, align with our inner rhythm, and step into the flow of life with confidence and grace. What to Expect Cacao Ceremony: We will begin with a sacred cacao ceremony, where you will be guided to connect with the spirit of cacao, open your heart, and set your intentions for the New Year. Shamanic Journeying Guided Meditation : A guided meditation will help you to envision your intentions clearly, aligning your mind, body, and spirit with your desired outcomes, anchoring your intentions into the earth and amplifying your connection with the collective energy of the group. Sharing Circle: There will be an opportunity to share your intentions with the group, if you feel called, creating a supportive community energy that will carry your intentions forward. This event is a sacred space for you to connect deeply with yourself, the earth, and the energies of the New Year. Whether you are new to these practices or have been journeying with them for years, you are welcome here. Please bring a crystal or a symbolic item to charge it with the New Year Intention and place it in the centre of the circle altar.

The circle will be open to evolution and a collaborative direction but to get us started the first 3 months will also act as standalone workshops: Thu 19 Sep: Using dreams to unleash our unconscious mind We will explore the Jungian concept of dreams, and how they can help access our unconscious. We will look at common dream themes, and look at ways to help dream recall and interpret symbols and the meaning of dreams. Feel free to bring any dreams with you and we can explore their messages to you. Thu 31 Oct: Using Tarot to access our shadow and intuition We will look at the Heros Journey, as told in Tarot through the major arcana cards, and examine how we can use the cards to access our unconscious, and work out what might be blocking our energy. We will look at ways that you can read Tarot for yourself and harness the power of your intuition. Feel free to bring a deck if you have one. Thu 28 Nov: Introduction to shadow work and uncovering triggers An introduction to Jungs concept of the shadow, what it is and how accessing our shadow can help us to get in touch with our true self, enabling us to make choices in our life from a calmer place, and direct our energy more effectively to what we really want from life. We will have some shadow coaching and post the session I will be offering a free 1:1 session to all comers. About Sue After 30+ years in a career in hospitality marketing, I was lucky enough to be able to retire from that world in 2021. I have spent most of the last 3 years on a journey inwards, training as a Jungian Life Coach, Yoga Teacher and Laugher Yoga Leader. All these modalities can help us to access our true selves, becoming calmer, more resilient and able to take control of our lives. I love helping people to step into truer versions of themselves, and am excited to be bringing this together at Together Culture so we can start a circle of intuition, learning and growth! I am a Certified Master Jungian Life Coach, 500RYT (Yin and Hatha Yoga), Certified Laugher Leader and Certified Tarot Reader.

To support our community, please grab your ticket via Eventbrite . We cant wait to see you there! Speaker bios: Dr. Veena Babu is a London-based GP, broadcaster, and health expert who frequently shares her insights on prominent platforms, including Channel 5 News, BBC Radio, and ITV, among others. A leading Bollywood dance choreographer, Dr. Babu combines her passion for lifestyle medicine with her expertise in clinical leadership. She has leveraged her medical background and creative talents to spearhead initiatives addressing health inequities globally, beginning with the launch of SADAH, the UKs first charity dedicated to improving the lives of South Asian diabetic patients. Her innovative dance projects have garnered over 50 million views on YouTube, enabling her to raise thousands of pounds for various causes, including Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, the Royal Society for Blind Children, and Kerala Flood Relief. Dr. Babu's recent collaboration with WaterAid brought her to 10 Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament, where she worked closely with MPs on health think tanks. In 2023, she had the privilege of interviewing global health ministers at the Africa Health Agenda International Conference in Rwanda. As her body of work continues to evolve, Dr. Babu remains committed to making a meaningful impact in health and wellness Joan Medland Co-founder and Co-CEO of Shoal Sustainable Savings App Joan is the Co-founder of Shoal, a sustainable savings app launching with a leading interest rate and FSCS protection, as well as the ability to support green and social projects globally. Before making the switch to intrapreneur in Standard Chartered Ventures incubation programme and completing multi-million dollar fundraises, Joan had a 15 year career in law, consulting and financial services. The idea for Shoal was born from an experience Joan had while looking for a savings product that did some good, and made a good financial return. After failing to find the right financial product with my high street bank, she took her research to the web at which point, feeling overwhelmed, she gave up. Claims were misleading or lacked transparency, financial performance was either uncompetitive or difficult to benchmark, or difficult to access the product without being high net worth. In bringing Shoal to market, it was important for the team to break down each of these barriers and have created innovative tools like your impact calculator which allows you to see how much CO2 youre avoiding or clean water youre creating, just by saving. Many people are thinking about sustainability in their lives, but don't realise how powerful their money is as a tool to influence positive outcomes especially when we join together with others. It's a common misconception that your money is just sat in your account, or locked up in a vault. But it's actually out there, doing things. Your bank uses it to provide loans to businesses and projects. And wouldn't it be great if you had a say over what your bank supports with your money? Over time, we aim to create a marketplace for sustainable finance to make it easier for you to save, spend and invest more sustainably. We'll do the homework for you, and bring the best, financially competitive products together in one place from a range of partners. Our mission is to break down barriers to empower people to achieve their financial goals in a way that promotes environmental and social responsibility.",

In this sacred act of honouring and clearing, we can then make space to receive any gifts, any powers, any talents and skills that our ancestors had, and that we are ready to embrace. This also makes space to offer prayers for our future generations, just like our ancestors did for us. Samhain is the Celtic honouring of the season between Autumn Equinox and Winter Solstice, journeying from the light and in to the depths of darkness. A time where the veil between worlds are at its thinnest, and thus offering a potent time to honour those who have passed and create space within us to heal and make prayers for future generations to come.

Take time to consult the Wisdom Oracle cards, receive energy healing and talk with others about all things esoteric.

        "summary": "Welcome to Sussex Sister Circles - Hove (for the Worthing Circle, please click here ) Led by qualified life coach and circle facilitator Erin Lewis, Sussex Sister Circles are spaces for women to be together, decompress and take off the many hats we wear each day. Our Circles are safe, welcoming environments for women to support each other, share their stories and uplift one another. Women have been gathering in circle in communities across the world for generations. Whether the purpose be to honour the time of a womans bleed, to discuss issues of importance to the community or to mark the changing seasons, circles have been spaces for women to be held, seen and simply be, for many thousands of years. Womens circles are still a significant part of life in many First Nations communities around the world, but in the West we seem to have forgotten them. Or have we? Do we not all know the joy of gathering with the closest women in our lives, sharing stories, seeking support and discussing the things that matter? For me, and I know for others too, there has always been a subtle but ever-present difference in how a space feels when only women are present. There is something about the way women sink into each other and connect more deeply when there are no men present. That is what we create at Sussex Sister Circles - a space for women to rest in feminine energy and connect with other women. Its as simple as that and we would love you to join us. What to bring Please bring a yoga mat (or similar) and a cushion to sit on. Chairs will be provided for those who need them. Please also bring something that holds meaning for you (a photo, piece of jewelry, keepsake). Please arrive at 6:15pm for a 6:30pm start. We will close by 7:45pm. We will be in the Dune room, upstairs at The Wilbury Clinic, 109 Church Road, Hove. About the facilitator Erin Lewis holds a Professional Coach Diploma from Optimus Coach Academy and is a trained womens circle facilitator. She works with clients who are ready to identify and break out of the patterns and stories that are keeping them stuck in life. She is passionate about empowering women and creating spaces where they can connect, share and support each other. Already established in Worthing and now coming to Hove, Sussex Sister Circles aims to do just that.",

We have experienced first-hand the deep healing and powerful transformation that shamanic work can facilitate when we are open to receiving guidance and knowledge from the liminal, otherworldly realms and the depths of our own being. Having studied with various teachers and shamans from around the world, we are passionate about sharing these modalities with those who seek holistic and alternative ways of healing. If youre interested in exploring shamanic healing, please join us for an afternoon of nourishing and joyful healing in community at the Bonnington Community Centre in Southwest London. Our community healings offer an opportunity to receive healing on emotional, physical and spiritual levels, re-establishing harmony, sovereignty and power. If you wish, you may join the 'healing chorus' to support the process with instruments and intention. Each participant receives a one-to-one shamanic healing. No previous experience required, just an open mind and heart. We are part of a larger network of shamanic practitioners and we occasionally invite other practitioners to help us faciliate our community events. Please note, the room is on the third floor of the building and unfortunately there is no wheelchair access. If you have any questions or need futher information, please email collectiveshamanic@gmail.com. We look forward to meeting you. Shamanic Collective What our clients say: \"Thank you all for an amazing afternoon! I attended not fully knowing what to expect as I have not been to many events like this before. The environment was very calm and welcoming, with a beautiful altar set up for us to place offerings on. The healing session was a calming yet empowering experience for me. I felt like I went into a deep state and could have quite happily stayed for hours! It was so lovely to sit afterwards and talk through the experience with Sarah one-to-one, and to gain some insights into myself. After the healing I felt very serene and uplifted, and at the same time had a feeling of childlike excitement that I haven't felt for some time. I would love to attend more events in the future and highly recommend to anyone who is seeking healing and guidance in a safe, comfortable space with experienced practitioners! Thank you all so much.\" - Martha",

Or are you dying to talk about your latest read with fellow book folk? Come on down to the Anti-Book Club! At the Anti-Book Club, there is no designated book of the month. Instead, everyone is invited to bring a book they recently finished - regardless of whether they liked, loved, or loathed it - and tell the rest of us what this book does (or doesnt do) for you. We are open to all kinds of books - audio, electronic, old school. In fact, it doesnt even have to be a book, as long as it is book-adjacent. And you dont have to bring the physical thing, just be willing to share something about it. The event will be facilitated by John Evans, long-time friend of SPACE4 and the cooperative movement, and Nida Sajid, resident librarian at creative collective Studio61, who will guide us through an evening of fun discussions. We will kick-off with an introduction by John and Nida, delving into their motivations for setting up the Anti-Book Club and what they hope to realise through it. We will then split up into smaller groups to chat about the books people have brought with them. Following this, we will reconvene as a room to share our insights and identify common themes across our audience-chosen book nook. There will be a selection of drinks and snacks available on the night as well as the option to purchase a home-cooked dinner, served up by Studio61s culinary team.

Mark is an award-winning qualified photographer and educator, with over 30 years of experience as a freelance photographer and holds a Master of Art in Photography, in addition to a BA (Hons) in photography degree; amongst other media qualifications . On first submission, Mark was awarded by his peers at the Royal Photographic Society, both Associate and Licentiate Distinctions. Mark is now a PhD candidate in photography, researching topography, the environment and the affect theory. What do past attendees say about Mark and his events? My 21-year-old daughter and I recently joined a Photowalk with Mark, at Valley of Rocks. It was a very enjoyable and educational experience. There were just two others, so a total of 5 in our group. Mark provided a comfortable environment for discussing the art and science of photography. He emphasized how personal photography can be and the importance of focusing on what we find compelling. He also provided instruction on the mechanics of a good photo as to structure, camera settings and other details. He was patient, very knowledgeable and clearly loves what he does. Thanks, Mark! Lisa, USA I was looking for someone to help me understand my canon camera whilst on holiday in Minehead. I am so glad that I booked a one-to-one day out with Mark. I cant say enough about how professional Mark is & how wonderful our day out together was. Mark instantly put me at ease and nothing was too much trouble for him to explain. Mark does this in a way that you can easily relate to in day to day scenarios. I have since joined Marks Lightroom Monday group and now enjoy learning all about post production of my images. Joan Middlesex I joined Mark on one of his 1 to 1 workshops New to Photography Workshop back in April 2019, I wanted to rejuvenate my hobby for photography, having been a member of a local camera club where if your face fits you were ok I wanted to understand more about photography and techniques, well 18 mths on having been a regular attendee on his walks and trips I feel I have learned much more from a very motivated, experienced educator and communicator. Malcom, Somerset Many thanks for all the help on your photography workshop in getting me away from auto settings, and understanding depth of field, rule of 3rds ect, it has been a great help in improving my photography skills and making everything even more enjoyable than I ever thought possible, Many thanks, Mark. Mike, Taunton, Somerset Mark has the knack of simplifying the technical. He is always available to answer questions, even when they have been asked before. Katrina, Minehead After having owned my Nikon DSLR camera for many years and never having taken it off Auto, I decided to join Mark on one of his Full Day Camera courses. He took me through the basics and encouraged me throughout the day, by adding new skills at varying locations. By the time we had finished, I felt confident to continue learning and practising my new skills. A great day for those who need to better understand their camera. Thanks Mark. Karen, Somerset Mark has endless patience, is very encouraging and has a wealth of knowledge, he has been a great support in helping me progress my intermediate photography skills from capturing the shot to editing in Lightroom. Joanne, Somerset We had some lovely days with sun, clouds, rain and wind. Today an Exmoor photographer showed us some beautiful places on Exmoor. Thank you Mark Stothard for taking us the whole day out and giving us a lot of tips ? Elma, Netherlands Marks passion for his art of photography, comes through in the warmth and professionalism he shows in all his workshops. He makes you feel welcome, relaxed and nothing is too much trouble! He simplifies instructions so that we can all understand. We all come away feeling greatly inspired and with new knowledge to become better photographers ourselves. His variety of workshops shows his broad knowledge. I particularly enjoyed the trip out onto Exmoor to photograph ponies and Highland cattle, where his enthusiasm is evident. The ambience of the smaller groups, where everyone is friendly and Mark inspires us to help each other, as well as sharing his tips and knowledge with us. I would thoroughly recommend attending any of his workshops.

With increasingly restricted budgets and services being strained to support more people, these sectors are forced to do more with fewer resources. This challenge is combined with high debt interest rates, mandatory improvement of home standards, strict energy efficiency objectives, and green targets. To alleviate pressure, a drive for operational efficiency and improved productivity is central to success and technology offers the opportunity to deliver services more cost-effectively, but with so many touch points, are there more efficient ways to connect to our communities? One way of doing this is the single front door. It provides a single point of contact between citizens and services. It triages individuals to ensure they receive the right service(s) at their point of need whether adult social care; tech-enabled care; debt advice, or digital inclusion. In this roundtable we will be joined by speakers including Matt Adam, Founder of We Are Group , a champion of connecting communities to ask how we can create more integrated services and discuss whether the single front door approach improves outcomes.

Location: The Cosy Club, Festival Place, Basingstoke A little background if your'e interested.... (although if your symptoms are anything like mine, I'm already distracted by this point!) Facilitated by me, Carli Adby, local resident, who started early menopause at 37 years - these groups are held once or twice a month and are supported by the 'Menopause Cafe.' (Originally started in 2017 and now global! www.menopausecafe.net ) I believe that coming together like this can be powerful and empowering - there is no obligation to be going through the menopause - taking autonomy in our own health choices as women and learn about our bodies; is universal. This is just something I wanted to start after struggling to find anyone to speak with about my seeminly random, sudden and often overwhelming symptoms which then turned out to be very early menopause. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Please pay attention to the principles of the menopause cafe - this is a not for profit, volunteer run platform and meetings are built upon respect, inclusion, accessibility and trust.

But where do you start? How do you contract for maximum growth and innovation? **If you want the low down on everything involved with protecting your valuable IP in all of the contracts you might need to protect it in- this is the session for you ** Agenda: In this highly practical 60-minute session, we will work through the following: Why is protecting your IP so important? Confidentiality is a key issue, should you disclose confidential information and if you do, how do you ensure that your NDAs actually protect it? Your start-up is only growing from here on out. There are going to be other people, employees and contractors and consultants, helping in the development of the business and perhaps the development of the IP. How can you be sure that no one else ends up with a claim to your IP? What are the key issues and pitfalls in your out-sourcing agreements and consultancy agreements to make sure you retain ownership and control of your IP and new IP that is developed? If youre a university spin-out, then youre unlikely to have ownership of all the IP you need to develop and grow your company. What kind of licence agreement should you expect from the university? What should you be looking for in the grant funding agreements that created the IP in the first place? Collaborations are great, but how do you negotiate the key rights you need when new IP is created? Investor Due Diligence: How can you be sure that youve got the IP rights you need to give investors confidence in your start-up? How to avoid the chaos. If you use any Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in your company, what are the legal issues and pitfalls to be aware of? Who is this for? This session is for anyone wanting to understand the legal arrangements around intellectual property in contracts and to help their company grow.

Our main goal is to encourage you to pause, guide you to relax and tune in the intuition while being surrounded by other sensitive women. Become a New Mama - open, trusting and capable. Gatherings take place at The Green Door Centre in Bosham 2pm - 4:30pm . Women are bombarded with information, rules and trends when it comes to all the stages of motherhood. Transition to motherhood, starting as early as researching the options for birth, can feel overwhelming, scary and lonely. We are being taught everything, but how to trust ourselves and tap into our intuition and instincts when it comes to giving birth and raising our children. The aspect that should come so naturally to a woman, when she is in contact with herself and with the world around her. So this is the space to practice exactly that - stop the worlds chattering, learn to relax, filter through the tons of information available and tune into what FEELS right. New Mamas circle is a su pportive community for empathetic women who are passionate about all things motherhood - from fertility and birth, all the way to mothering and finding herself in the new role. This is a child free event, but mamas are welcome to join us with pre crawlers. We meditate, talk about our ideal vision of motherhood and speak our fears and struggles with no interruption, doubt or blame. Its not the place for judgment or advice, but acceptance and encouragement. What is shared in the circle stays there! You leave the circle feeling whole, powerful and part of a beautiful community. We will be building on the knowledge from one Circle to the other, but I planned all the New Mamas Circles so that they can be attended independently and in any order, before or after birth. If you want to reserve a space for all 6 Circles for 185 (instead of 210) or book a FREE ticket* space, get in touch . *FREE tickets are available at the baby fairs I attend - follow me on Instagram or subscribe to my Email linst to find out about the next one.",

        "summary": "The event will be an opportunity to network with likeminded businesses in the area and discuss the sustainability related issues facing the world. We'll also hear from a range of speakers about what they're doing in their particular industries, and what sustainable practices you can take away to address your own goals. A light breakfast will be provided from 8:30am, featuring locally sourced food and drink. Speaker Profiles: Martin White: Four years ago under lockdown, and as part of his personal journey towards greater self-awareness of the environment and climate change, Martin founded his own sustainability consultancy Green Business Hub. Martin now advises a diverse range of private and public sector clients on their ESG strategy, encouraging them to think more holistically about sustainability rather than solely focusing on climate action and Net Zero - because they have to - to include alignment with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals and increasingly Social Value Add frameworks. Andrew Pledger: Andrew is the Ecosystem Manager at Barclays Eagle Labs in Discovery Park. The Eagle Labs mission is to connect the UKs entrepreneurial ecosystem through a network of business incubators, expertise and support. With access to over 325 years of business expertise and connections, Eagle Labs are a community resource available for everybody. Whether youre an inventor, an innovator or a mentor, Eagle Labs spaces are conducive to nurturing and growing your idea with support from Barclays and the Eagle Labs network. Sergei Panov: Head of HTPEM Product Development at ZeroAvia. Aviation is the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas emissions. Todays aircraft engines emit substances in addition to CO2 that double or even triple aviations climate impact! NOx, contrails, and particulates have a specific warming effect of their own. Non-carbon emissions are thought to account for around two-thirds of climate impact. The Solution: Scalable hydrogen and electric propulsion technologies to drastically reduce environmental harm and lower costs. ZeroAvia's mission is a hydrogen-electric, zero-emission powertrain in every aircraft. From 19-seat regional trips to over 100-seat long-distance flights, ZeroAvia enables scalable, sustainable aviation by replacing conventional engines with hydrogen-electric powertrains. ZeroAvia are a team of passionate innovators dedicated to bringing safe, zero-emission flight to aviation, with locations in Kemble and London in the UK, and Hollister, California. Beth Janson: Strategic Business Development Manager at Countrystyle Recycling. Countrystyle Recycling is spearheading a new initiative aimed at reducing landfill waste. A family-run business based in Kent, Countrystyle has introduced an innovative closed-loop recycling program to tackle the 250,000 tonnes of coffee grounds that end up in landfills annually, contributing to harmful emissions. Through this program, coffee grounds are repurposed into nutrient-rich fertiliser, providing an eco-friendly solution that supports both environmental sustainability and businesses efforts to achieve their green objectives. Q&A Discussion Panel: A discussion panel/Q&A will follow the presentations hosted by Martin White from Green Business Hub.",

        "summary": "Exhibition Dates 29th October - 9th November 2024 | Willesden Gallery Private View: 31st October 2024 | 6 to 8 pm About the Exhibition Susanne Baumann presents her first solo exhibition: \"Fading Echoes\" - a poignant and thought-provoking collection of paintings, created between 2022 and now. She invites you to an intimate exploration of what makes someone present, and the silence and empty spaces they leave behind when they are not. \"Fading Echoes\" is more than an exhibition; it is an intimate narrative of Baumann's personal odyssey through the labyrinth of grief and memory. The artist's father's 20-year long battle with Alzheimer's has left an indelible mark, shaping her in profound ways. This deeply personal struggle forms the core of Baumann's current work, as she endeavours to visually express the slow and heartbreaking process of witnessing a loved one slowly fade away. Baumann's art delves into her experience of absence - not just as a void but as a tangible presence. Her paintings evoke the quiet murmurs of memories; the remnants of a presence that lingers, long after the people we knew are gone. Each piece is an acknowledgement of the continuous passage of time and the way it erodes memory, identity, and our connections to those we love. Fading Echoes is driven by the question: What remains of us when we slowly but surely disappear - is it just echoes of ourselves? About the Artist Susanne Baumann is a German artist, currently based in London. She completed her Master's Degree in Painting at the Royal College of Art in 2023, having obtained a distinction in her Graduate Diploma there in Art & Design with a focus on Fine Arts in 2022. She has co-curated, organised, and participated in group exhibitions at numerous locations throughout London, including: D Contemporary, 4 Corners Gallery, Willesden Gallery, HSBC Head Quarters, Royal College of Art, Core Arts Gallery, Citizens Art London Gallery, and Safehouse 1&2. From September to November she shows work in Shanghai at Astra Art Gallery. She was longlisted for the Visual Art Open 2023 and has been granted a place in the Professional Development Program 2024 with new platform.art.",

The meeting will also consider the disruption of these processes in disease settings. Additionally we hope that by understanding more about the complex developmental interactions of stem cells and their progeny with each other and with immune cells, we will open doors to the various novel cell and gene therapy strategies that the symposium will also consider. The symposium will bring together internationally renowned experts who adopt different but complementary approaches, spanning basic science, developmental processes, and clinical applications, addressing unmet medical needs that affect huge numbers of people globally. Sessions will include : Epithelial stem cells; thymus biology and haematopoietic stem cells; tolerance; gene and cell therapy; immunity and cancer; organ morphogenesis, regeneration and pluripotent stem cells.

A language for exploring and discussing organisational issues issues that aren't only process-related Found the ideas of context and awareness tied well into managing different relationships This rounds out organisational change aspects any serious practitioner should know Really related to Organising at Human Scale; Energised by the mapping exercises before and after it Previously known as \"Leading in a Transforming Organisation\" and run in London, Berlin, Melbourne, Manchester, this is three modules of Leading with Outcomes as an integrated, workshop-style training experience: Day 1. Leading with Outcomes: Foundation Day 2. Adaptive Organisation (I): Business agility at every scale Day 3. Adaptive Organisation (II): Between spaces, scopes, and scales We'll be exploring what it means to lead in an organisation where change is happening wherever it's needed, at the pace it's needed, and engaging the people who are needed everyone whose energy, insights, and innovations you'll need. On day 1 (Foundation) we look at how to develop and pursue strategy in the language of outcomes, introducing some key conversational and organisational patterns and tools. You'll be developing skills you can not only bring to set-piece strategy events such as reviews and workshops but apply in everyday settings too. On days 2 and 3 (Adaptive Organisation parts I and II), we will be exercising those skills further as we get to grips with a classic and powerful model of organisation that we've made accessible and brought up to date, applicable to organisations of all shapes and sizes. For any given organisational scale (day 2), what are the preconditions for business agility, and what gets in the way of that? Similarly, in what practical ways can we help the relationships between organisational scales (day 3) to be more healthy and productive? You'll be learning some of the deep magic of organising how to understand it in terms of relationships and constraints and you won't look at organisations in quite the same way again! Audience You can approach Leading in a Transforming Organisation in complementary ways: As a workshop, an opportunity to explore how your organisation (or your client organisation) works and how you might influence that As leadership development, participants invited for their growth potential As technical training, participants attending out of interest in the models covered Per the final section below, as a near-alternative to Leading with Outcomes: Train-the-Trainer / Facilitator If any of those speak to you, you're invited!

The tightly packed core of ancient colleges, the picturesque riverside 'Backs' (college gardens) and the leafy green meadows surrounding the city give it a more tranquil appeal than its historic rival Oxford. Like 'the Other Place', as Oxford is known locally, the buildings here seem unchanged for centuries, and it's possible to wander around the college buildings and experience them as countless prime ministers, poets, writers and scientists have done. Sheer academic achievement seems to permeate the very walls: cyclists loaded down with books negotiate cobbled passageways, students relax on manicured lawns and great minds debate life-changing research in historic pubs. First-time punters zigzag erratically across the river, and those long past their student days wonder what it would have been like to study in such splendid surroundings.

But in other areas, hydrogen and its derivatives still look like the best or possibly only option: fertilizer, shipping, jet aviation and long-duration grid balancing. Whats more, regardless of the higher production costs of cleaner forms of hydrogen, its system benefits in terms of greater energy security and lower overall energy system costs still look potentially enormous. It is therefore time to take stock. Both the UK and the EU need to ask what their policy is getting wrong and whether they could make faster progress, and at lower cost, by working together. In 2024, HyDEX (Hydrogen Development and Knowledge Exchange) and ERA (Energy Research Accelerator) held a series of summits in Brussels and London where academics, policymakers and industrialists examined the issue of hydrogen collaboration between the UK and EU. At this FREE event at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in London, ERA and HyDEX will be launching their 'UK-EU Hydrogen Policy Report' with a host of speakers from industry and the public sector, outlining the case for UK-EU collaboration, with specific recommendations to develop hydrogen infrastructure, markets and policy.",

        "summary": "Women make up more than half of would-be lawyers graduating from law school and while women are well represented in law firms - they make up over half of lawyers in law firms - the underrepresentation of women becomes more apparent at senior levels, and many leave the industry at Associate level. But retaining female talent is key to ensuring not simply diversity in law firms, but fresh perspectives, clearer thinking, innovation, collaboration, and trust as well. Lawyers, law firms, businesses, and organisations need to open access to a wide and diverse pool of talent at entry level, and provide support, sponsorship, and working flexibility to remove the structural barriers that cause women lawyers to leave their professions before they are ready to do so. The discussion will be based on personal experiences in the legal profession, looking at some of the most pressing issues faced by women in law today.

If youre a Seed to Series-B consumer startup or B2B enabler for the consumer sector currently fundraising or looking to fundraise in the next 6-9 months, you simply cannot afford to miss this event! Why rev? Pitching to VCs takes a chunk of time and loads of energy, and every rejection takes a little chip out of the soul, as an entrepreneur, you'd better be pitching to the right investors! As a startup founder, you have hundreds of other things to do, so weve structured rev to deliver fast, efficient insights to make the best use of your time. What happens at rev? rev is more than finding alignment with a VC's investment thesis, it's about finding where your personalities and chemistry resonate. We're here to help you discover the right investors efficiently. Each VC has five minutes to pitch, followed by your questions. Afterwards, immerse yourself in networking and leave a lasting impression! What do you mean by Consumer Investor We define a consumer investor as someone who invests in businesses across diverse sectors including but not limited to traditional CPG brands, whose technologies and innovations have mass consumer appeal e.g. the Creator Economy. We welcome VCs, CVCs, Angel Investors/Syndicates and other finance providers backing DTC/e-commerce startups including debt financing, media capital, revenue share, working capital, and other innovation capital solutions. We have a limited number of investor-speaking slots. If youre a consumer VC, CVC, e-commerce/DTC finance provider including debt financing and brave enough to pitch in front of 100+ founders, please register with this link , and well coordinate with you. By presenting at rev, you're not just gaining access to a select group of founders, you're contributing to a larger mission. Together we can eliminate the \"spray and pray\" approach to fundraising, and foster more meaningful and productive connections that benefit both founders and funders.

        "summary": "Climate change has disastrous consequences for the natural water cycles in South Asia and the Indus basin, leading to frequent floods and droughts, elevated food & energy insecurity, and the depletion of critical water resources. For communities, the availability of timely information about uncertain hydrometeorological variables has become extremely important for achieving high crop water productivity, signaling the onset of heatwaves, and the early warning of floods & droughts. Hidden state variables such as soil moisture, snow depth, and local meteorology provide critical insights for attributing extreme events to climate change. In light of these needs, we summarize our work on indigenously building large-scale earth observation networks using a fusion of many technologies and with the participation of communities. This presents many opportunities for systems thinking . Our data-collection efforts, combined with agent-based socio-hydrological models and basin-scale integrated assessment models have enabled large-scale policy interventions for irrigation demand management, the exploration of nature-based solutions in agriculture, preparation for rare events in transboundary rivers, and generation scenarios for investment options in the Water-Energy-Food-Climate nexus. Dr. Abubakr Muhammad is an associate professor of electrical engineering, the founding director of the Center for Water Informatics & Technology (WIT), and the lead for NCRA Agricultural Robotics Lab at LUMS, Pakistan. He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, USA winning an institute-wide best Ph.D. Dissertation Award. Following postdoctoral fellowships at the University of Pennsylvania and McGill University he joined LUMS in 2008, where his group does research in agricultural robotics, human-water systems and climate analytics. He has held visiting positions at other top institutes including the University of Oxford, ICTP, and KAUST.

Richard Portes, Professor of Economics at London Business School will be the moderator for this discussion. The principle concept of this book considers that fiat money represents the equity capital of a nation, while the cost of inflation mirrors the dilutions faced by the shareholders. The authors explore two central questions: How does money flow into the economy, and what is it used to purchase? The book presents a comprehensive framework that links the real economy with its monetary counterpart, emphasising the critical role of the banking sector and debt.

The Leaders of ASEAN during the 42nd and 43rd ASEAN Summits in Indonesia in 2023 agreed to work towards an ASEAN Vision 2045, which will replace the current ASEAN Vision 2025: Forging Ahead Together. The ASEAN Vision 2045 is set to shape the destiny of the ASEAN region, which is one of the most economically dynamic economic regions and predicted to collectively be the 4th largest economy in the world. ASEAN faces a lot of challenges and uncertainties in moving towards the next phase of regional integration. Firstly, ASEAN needs to foster unity and solidarity among its member states in facing the regional and global geo-economic challenges. ASEAN has to be able to address the elephants in the room, i.e. the uncertainty in Myanmar, and the more assertive China in its own backyards. ASEAN Member States have also not been able to specifically find common grounds on other conflicts such as in the Middle-East and the Russia-Ukraine, what more with Taiwan facing a much greater threat from China. Secondly, ASEAN will have to address the inclusive growth and economic disparity among its own member states, including Timor-Leste. The economic disparity is further exacerbated by issues like climate change; rapid technology changes where most ASEAN Member States are technology adopters instead of technology frontrunners; competition for resources such as critical minerals, renewable energy, and food security and the uncertain global and regional financial landscape. Finally, ASEAN may have to play an important role in the re-globalisation, where ASEAN as a region plays an important role in re-igniting the multilateral trading system, whilst continuing addressing the regional trade and investment priorities like the full and effective implementation of the RCEP. Most importantly, ASEAN Vision 2045 will be the catalyst for regional and global economic growth, setting the pace for peace, stability and prosperity in this region. This event is being run in collaboration with Malay World Studies, St Catharines College, and will be followed by a drinks reception.

        "summary": "Join the African Leadership Organization at the UK-Africa Partnerships Forum on the 21st of November 2024 at the House of Lords, UK . The forum will bring together top policymakers, industry leaders, and visionaries from across the UK and Africa to explore and harness the continent's burgeoning potential. The UK has maintained a long-standing relationship with Africa, historically focused on trade, investment, and development aid. However, the UK's exit from the European Union has prompted a rethinking of its foreign economic policies, particularly toward Africaa continent poised for significant economic growth. In 2023, Africa was seen as one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, with a collective GDP of over $3 trillion. Despite global economic challenges, Sub-Saharan Africa's economy grew by an estimated 3.6% in 2023, with projections to reach around 4.1% by 2024 due to robust performance in key sectors like agriculture, energy, and telecommunications. The UK has responded by recalibrating its relationships through bilateral agreements. In 2021, the UK signed Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with countries like Kenya, Ghana, and the Southern African Customs Union, ensuring continuity in trade post-Brexit. By 2023, UK-Africa trade was valued at approximately 40 billion, with major exports including machinery, pharmaceuticals, and financial services. However, there is untapped potential to expand trade beyond traditional sectors and drive innovation-led growth across both economies. Though trade between the UK and Africa continues to grow, there is still significant room for expansion. Relatedly, Africa accounts for about 2.5% of total UK exports, and UK Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Africa reached 50 billion by 2023, largely concentrated in extractive industries, financial services, and infrastructure. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into effect in 2021, and covers 54 African nations with a combined market of over 1.3 billion people, represents a transformative opportunity for UK businesses to access new markets and diversify trade relationships. In 2023, the AfCFTA's potential to boost intra-African trade by 52.3% by 2025 and increase trade with external partners like the UK presents enormous opportunities for collaboration. However, Africa still faces significant challenges in infrastructure development, trade facilitation, and financial inclusion, areas where UK expertise could play a pivotal role. One of the main challenges to expanding UK-Africa partnerships is the need for better policy alignment and regulatory cooperation. Africas regulatory landscape is complex, with varying rules on investment, trade, and digital services across the continent. The UK, through its Department for International Trade and Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), has been working on developing more harmonized trade and investment frameworks with African governments. The UK-Africa Partnership Forum would therefore create a platform for advancing mutual interests and unlocking new opportunities in trade, innovation, and sustainable development. The event will build upon the strong foundation of existing trade, investment, and development relationships between the UK and Africa, reinforcing established partnerships while identifying areas for expansion and deepening engagement, facilitating discussions and interactions that uncover and develop new avenues for collaboration, as well as influence the future trajectory of UK-Africa relations through high-level dialogue and strategic partnerships, ensuring that both regions benefit from shared prosperity and development. Key Highlights of the Forum 1) Keynote Addresses & High-Level Thematic Panel Discussions 2) Bilateral Meetings, Policy Alignment Discussions & Exclusive Networking Sessions 3) Workshops and Breakout Sessions 4) Exhibition and Showcase (Countries and States Governments Investment Showcase) 5) Unveiling of the African Leadership Magazines special publications",

This exciting conference will take place at the Oracle, Thames Valley Park, Reading at 10am (registration from 09:30). Get ready to immerse yourself in a day filled with captivating talks, interactive workshops, and engaging discussions led by renowned experts in the field. The conference aims to foster knowledge sharing, inspire action, and promote collaboration among like-minded individuals. Lunch and refreshments included. Programme: Talk: Harveet Purewal, TVERC Micro-Intern Student The effect of climate change on the distribution of the Brown hairstreak over time Harveet is a current biology student at Oxford University and has completed a week long internship with TVERC looking at possible distribution shifts in the Brown hairstreak due to climate change and its implications for the conservation of the species. Talk: Rob Curtis, TVERC Berkshire Biodiversity Officer Berkshire Local Wildlife Sites Update Talk: Catriona Bass Towards a Protocol for community-based plant propagation for landscape-scale meadow restoration Organisations: Long Mead Foundations Thames Valley Wildflower Meadow Restoration Project & Nature Recovery Network Catriona Bass will be drawing evidence from Long Mead Foundations Thames Valley Wildflower Meadow Restoration Project and Nature Recovery Networks community propagation of rare and slow-growing plants for their community-driven, landscape-scale restoration of floodplain meadows, now in its 6th Year. The talk will cover both data the project has collected on the community propagation of individual native species (eg seed storage, germination rates, growing times, seed viability of individual species) as well as their learning on using recycled materials and creating their own zero miles compost. Talk: Dr Julian Parfitt South East Strategic Reservoir Option: Ancient and Veteran Trees, Bats, Birds and Fungi The proposed Abingdon Reservoir (SESRO) would occupy 4.5 square miles of floodplain within the River Ock catchment, with a water surface roughly equivalent in size to Gatwick Airport. Significant biodiversity net gain has been claimed by Thames Water from a desk-based exercise and limited surveys undertaken during the winter of 2021/22. To provide independent scrutiny of Thames Waters BNG claims, a baseline habitat survey and condition assessment was carried out during the period March to July 2024. Results indicate that Thames Waters BNG claims were dependent on a significant under-estimation of the areas baseline biodiversity. These conclusions have been supported by extensive surveys across the site, data acquisition from farmers and the use of LandApp to geo-reference data and to recalculate BNG from the revised habitat baselines. This presentation will focus on the fieldwork and recording undertaken during 2024 as well as highlighting some of the wildlife that this threatened green corridor supports. Dr Julian Parfitt has worked in the environmental sector for over 40 years and has been a keen naturalist for a lot longer. As an environmental consultant and academic he has worked as an expert advisor on waste and resource management issues for major retailers, Defra and the European Commission. Now semi-retired he works as a volunteer at RSPB Otmoor and has devoted the last few months to recording the biodiversity across the SESRO area. To carry out the fieldwork he travels by mountain bike and, to this end, has cycled nearly 500 miles since the beginning of March.

Chloe Edwards, Oxfordshire LNRS Update Speed Updates : WildCookham: \" A Decaid of WildCookham\", Brian Clews Wild Windsor: Expanding our work and positive impacts in RBWM\", Susy Shearer Imogen Parker, Wild Oxfordshire Updates Sue Downhill, Trust for Oxfordshire's Environment Berkshire Ornithological Club Updates, Neil Bucknell British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) Updates, John Melling Local Geological Sites (LGS), Lesley Dunlop Burgess Field and local schools, Kim Polgreen Workshops: Lisa Phipps, Keep Nethercote Rural Citizen Science and Biodiversity Recording We all love taking part in big national projects such as The Big Garden Birdwatch in January or the Big Butterfly Count in the summer. All year round we can be citizen scientists and contribute important information just by recording what nature we see! Wildlife conservation relies on records and data. Knowing what species we have and where empowers us to protect them, to target biodiversity enhancement projects to support them and to monitor trends in their distribution. Citizen science allows everyone to record the nature around them, allowing a much more diverse and wider understanding of our natural world whilst building our own personal knowledge and skills. During this workshop we will consider how you can contribute data and be involved in recording biodiversity as a citizen scientist, including some demonstrations and practical activities. Marcus Simmons, The Oxfordshire Nature Project, Community Action Groups Oxfordshire How free interactive mapping tools can help local species recording Good species recording work often calls for defining, revising, sharing or printing data on which areas are of interest, what things are present in each area, and other aspects such as access, ownership, other conditions. Its also often important to show accurate locations of observations and photographs, and to create and review data entries collaboratively. Frequently theres a need to link with to current and planned interventions or development proposals. The smart way to create and interact with all this is to use an interactive mapping tool that shows your information in various ways, displayed against a chosen map background. It can also be valuable to make interactive view-only maps for easy access by the public, including linking or embedding in web or social-media pages This workshop will introduce free, user-friendly mapping tools and tips for how to easily achieve all these things. It will include a good amount of time for questions and discussions, and a briefing sheet you can have at the end. Displays: There will be a range of display stands from different recording and conservation groups which you can visit during refreshment and lunch breaks. Please indicate on your booking form if you would like to bring a display and/or leaflets. How to get there: For directions, see: Google maps . Lunch and refreshments included. There is also free car parking at the venue. Many thanks to Oracle for their continued support for this event About TVERC TVERC are a not-for-profit organisation hosted by Oxfordshire County Council. We collect, analyse and share geodiversity and biodiversity information in Berkshire and Oxfordshire to help people make sound decisions about how to develop and manage land sustainably, where to direct wildlife conservation work and for scientific education and research. There are many people collecting information about our natural environment and by collating all this information at TVERC, everyone can get a better picture of the status and distribution of wildlife.",

        "summary": "Land and agrarian struggles are fundamental to emancipation yet the politics of good food, in wealthy nations, is underwhelming. In places like the US and Europe, the radical promise of a post-capitalist food system and land reform tends to be watered down. Technocratic, apolitical narratives tend to dominate such as farm-to-table restaurants, regenerative agriculture, eco certifications, and nature-based solutions. The radical anti-capitalist potential of agroecology and food sovereignty becomes instead a capitalist reform. The structuring dynamics of race, class and gender become assimilated into the dominant liberal worldview. Actors, activists, and academics seeking radical food and agrarian politics draw inspiration from active political struggles such as the militancy of MST, the success of Cuban organopnicos, and the international organising of La Via Campesina. Radical international movements for agroecology and food sovereignty are crucial, especially as imperialist relations inextricably structure relations between the North and South. But the mistake we observe is the attempt to straightforwardly translate the politics of peasant movements and agroecological practices to the Global North. Instead, what is needed is a careful unravelling of the material structures and narratives that drive and maintain agriculture in the North. When proposing alternatives, the lack of engagement with the question of land (as a property relation) creates a vacuum that is filled by rural romanticisation on one side and glistening ecomodernism on the other. For some, the food and farming system will be transformed through rural landholders producing for their local community, while for others a land-sparing rhetoric drives images of overyielding industrial production and a clearing of the countryside for wild nature. While these competing narratives struggle for legitimacy, a growing Green Agenda barrels ahead that supports the status quo, veiling the landscape and labour exploitation behind it. This symposium intends to bring the land and agrarian struggles into a spatial design audience while laying the groundwork to break through these deadlocks, with an eye to synergising ecological reforms with land and agrarian change, rather than these two things being at odds. Architecture-and-landscape-oriented design tends to focus on urban narratives, concealing the global food system's detrimental impacts and forms of oppression, even though agriculture occupies nearly half of the Earths surface and more than 70% of UK land. Centring these struggles aims at proposing new ways of seeing the landscapes that fuel urbanisation processes, bringing to the fore those dependencies. It seeks to reflect on practical pathways for transformation out of the failures of the good food movement in Europe and by extension other wealthy nations. The day aims to bring together actors, activists and academics, to discuss more radical futures for agroecology and food sovereignty in the wealthy countries of the North. The first session examines land struggles in the UK today and how they hamper the imagination of radical transitions, the second looks at who is imagined as the revolutionary subject of agroecology, and we close by discussing the role of (anti)imperialist political struggles. This event is organised by the Root and Branch Collective (RBC), a scholar-activist group dedicated to research and action for a radical agrarian studies approach geared specifically to the political ecology of Europe. Rob Booth, Adam Calo, Sophia Doyle, Daniel Hartley, Alex Heffron, Olivia Oldham, Clara Oloriz Sanjuan and Alfredo Ramirez from RBC will participate. Each session will start with short guest presentations and finish with a round table discussion. 10.30 to 12.00 Session 1 Land struggles in the UK today Chaired by: Olivia Oldham (RBC) Presenters: Christabel Buchanan (Shared Assets), Keir Milburn (Abundance) and Naomi Beingessner 12.00 to 13.00 Lunch Break 13.00 to 14.30 Session 2 Who is imagined as the revolutionary subject of agroecology Chaired by: Alex Heffron (RBC) Presenters: Catherine McAndrew, Claire Ratinon (SALT, Solidarity Across Land Trades) 14.30 to 15.30 Coffee Break 15.30 to 17.00 Session 3 (Anti)imperialist political struggles (Hybrid: Online and in-person) Chaired by: Adam Calo and Sophia Doyle (RBC) Presenters: Antonio Roman-Alcala, David Gilbert and Inea Lehner (Climate Vanguard) 17.00 to 17.30 Conclusions/ Action points Image credit: David Gilbert Caption: The gate leading to Casiavera's reclaimed land in Sumatra.

The transformation that is urgently required will only be possible if the attitudes of individuals and society change. For this reason, behavioural dynamics must also be considered in the context of space. Why, how and where people travel ultimately comes down to the combination of many different factors. There are many layers and dimensions to this individual behaviour and it must be considered in integrated planning processes. This acatech DISCUSSION (publication available only in German) is the second interim report on the project Integrated urban development and mobility planning and as such it explores behaviour as the crux of integrated urban development and mobility planning and its realisation.

        "summary": "Hello Beautiful! As the night of Halloween and Samhain's sacred festival approaches, we celebrate a time when the veil between the physical and spiritual worlds is at its thinnest. This is a powerful moment to honour the cycles of life and death, to reflect on the past, and to connect deeply with our inner selves and those who have come before us. Join me for a profound Sound Bath experience where we will journey through the healing vibrations of sound, allowing ourselves to access a deeper state of awareness. Through the gentle resonance of the bowls, gongs, and chimes, well create a space for intuitive connection and honouring our ancestors and loved ones who have passed. We will start with Drum Journey and flow with Mars gong, finishing with Angelic Vibrations and Crystal Singing Bowls. Our Soul simply calls us to join into those sessions. So if you feel call - let your Soul Guide you. At this session, you will discover the benefits of Guided Meditation, Chant and Sound Healing, particularly with the use of Gong. The vibrations of the Gong can penetrate deep into our bodies, where we often hold onto unexpressed emotions that can create blockages. Allowing the Gong to travel through these spaces, helps to unravel these knots and emotions, creating new openings and allowing us to process and experience peace. You will be also experiencing instruments such as the Shamanic Drum, Water Drum, Chimes, Voice, Light Language, and Shakers. These will facilitate Sound Healing, which will enhance your physical and energetic well-being. Minor instruments are used to harmonize with your energy and heighten your experience. We will conclude the session with a period of silence to allow for integration, after which I will bring you back to the present moment. Let me share with you some of the most common benefits of Sound Baths: - better pain management, - reduced stress, - fewer mood swings, - improved sleep, - less chronic pain and blood pressure, - better productivity, - and many many more. After holding a Sound Bath, I notice a significant change in people's appearance. Their eyes seem to sparkle with newfound vitality, and their souls appear more present. Their faces lift and brighten, and the stress seems to disappear from their expressions. They also seem to carry less weight on their shoulders. I highly recommend attending this event to everyone. Sound Baths are excellent modern tools that aid people in living a calmer and more present life in the fast-paced world of today. If you're already looking after your well-being or want to start doing so, this tool can significantly enhance your energy levels, help you relax, and manage your stress. DETAILS: Location: 89 Melison Rd, London SW17 9AS Parking: Free parking on streets outside the venue. Time: 7:30 pm - 9:00 pm Please arrive from 7:15 pm - so we can start on time @ 7:30 pm. I will meet you in the hall. Doors will close at 7:30 pm, as not to disturb the session. Please make sure to come on time and check your journey ahead. In case of any delays please text. Please don't drink any alcohol before the event. WHAT TO BRING & WEAR: It is advisable to wear comfortable clothing during the sound bath session, as you will be lying on the mat for almost an hour. In addition, your body may feel cooler than usual, so layering can be a good option. Don't forget to bring a water bottle to ensure you stay hydrated before and after the session. Bring a yoga mat, blanket, sleeping bag, and cushion, eye mask or pashmina - create your wonderful nest for yourself. Please be aware that I don't have those in the hall.

        "summary": "The Centre for Commercial Law Studies at Queen Mary University of London is delighted to host a book launch for Rules for Trade in Services 2.0 Adapting the GATS to a Changing Trade Landscape (Routledge, 2024), written by Gabriel Gari, former Reader in International Economic Law at this institution. The book explores the adaptation process of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) to a constantly changing trade and policy context. Back in 1994, the adoption of the GATS, a multilateral agreement with stand-alone rules and principles for the governance of trade and investment in services, represented a watershed in the history of global trade governance. Three decades after the adoption of the Agreement, WTO Members struggle to deliver on the GATS mandate to achieve progressively higher levels of trade liberalisation in a radically different trade and policy landscape. Digital technologies have transformed the way we trade, what we trade, and who trades like never before. The rising number of Preferential Services Agreements contest the role of the GATS and the WTO as the centre of gravity for the governance of trade in services. The rise of China to the centre stage of world trade has altered the balance of power underpinning the multilateral trading system. Pressing environmental challenges and national security concerns are making it increasingly difficult to reconcile free trade with non-trade policy concerns. In years to come, additive manufacturing, the internet of things, distributed ledger technology, and artificial intelligence will continue to reduce trade costs, blurring the distinction between goods and services and raising the relevance of data flows and intellectual property. Against this background, this book examines the contribution of the WTO negotiating, adjudicative, and deliberative functions to adapting the GATS to changing trade and policy circumstances. The book uncovers an extremely flexible and adaptable agreement whose full potential has yet to be realised due to a complex set of non-service specific factors. The book distils the factors at play that constrain WTO Members capacity to adapt the Agreement to changing circumstances and explores potential pathways to overcome them. The author will present an overview of the book followed by reactions from four discussants in a thought-provoking discussion about the future of the GATS in a fast changing trade and policy landscape. The event will be followed by a drinks reception for those in attendance. This event is hybrid.",

        "summary": "What to Bring A candle A pre-written journal entry (prompt below) Anything else you'd like at your altar (crystals, tarot, etc) What to Expect Whether you have never been to a circle before or this is your 15th time, I welcome you. No two circles are ever the same. The evening starts with happy hour and light refreshments before settling into circle as a group. We meditate to my Nepali singing bowls and then we will read one another's journal entries out loud. Please don't worry - all of us are in the same boat (I write an entry, too) so it's completely okay if you feel awkward or vulnerable about your thoughts being shared. Try to write from the heart as much as possible. We don't have enough spaces for true open, non-judgmental dialogue anymore and that's the goal of this circle and community. What to Write Please write 1-2 pages typed up on your phone/computer or handwritten in response to any of the following questions. Take a look at the next section below for more inspiration. How can I assert my individuality and desires (Aries energy) while maintaining balance and harmony in my relationships (Libra energy)? What fears or old patterns am I ready to release under this full moon, and how can embracing both my fiery drive and my need for connection help me transform? As I reflect on the themes of courage and partnership, where in my life can I boldly take the lead while still honoring the partnerships and collaborations that support me? What's going on in the cosmos? October's full moon is the 3rd of 4 consecutive supermoons this year, which means it's extra potent energy as the moon is much closer to the Earth than usual. It's called the Blood Moon (or sometimes, Hunter Moon) which, in indgenous traditions, signaled a time that hunters started hunkering down and preparing for winter. This month also instills feelings of \"spooky season\" with Friday the 13th, a solar eclipse, and a lunar eclipse coming up on Halloween weekend. This spooky spectacle doesn't occur often so we might all be feeling this energy extra potently. This moon occurs during Libra season, a very balanced and rational sign rooted in planning and structure. Yet it occurs in the sign of Aires, a firey warrior sign that coincides with the hunter moon nicely. Many themes of this moon will relate to the balance between our inner, impulsive warrior and the part of us that likes to keep the peace or harmony in our relationships. While Aires is very focused on pursuing their own goals and desires, Libra is the sign of relationships and harmony - so this full moon may bring up themes around self versus other. Full Evening Agenda 1. MOONSHINE & GROUND RULES We'll mix and mingle for a bit until everyone arrives. There will be light refreshments and snacks served for a happy hour before settling into our circle. Then we'll go over the basics to set up a mindful space for sharing. 2. SET INTENTIONS & LIGHT CANDLES We go around the circle and state 1 thing we hope to gain from this experience as we each light our candle in front of us. 3. MEDITATE We'll spend 10 minutes meditating by candlelight to the sound of my singing bowls lovingly made under a full moon in Nepal. Spend time reflecting on our goals, connecting as a group, and getting in touch with our bodies as we enter zen self-reflection mode. 4. INTROSPECT This will be a large part of our evening. One by one we will read each other's journal entries aloud to the rest of the group. The purpose is to have a space to be purely heard. No dialogue yet, just listening. 5. EXTROSPECT Dialogue ensues. Each circle member gets the chance to comment on whichever they heard from others. Did something evoke a strong reaction? Make you think in a new way? Feel free to share anything that comes up. 6. GRATEFULNESS & GAIN Each member of the circle states one person/place/thing they are grateful for having or currently experiencing in their lives. 7. HOPEFUL LOSS Circle members state one thing they hope to reduce/lose/let go of in the coming weeks as they blow out their candles one by one 8. CLOSING THOUGHTS A chance for open dialogue, feedback, connecting with other members of the circle and easing back into the routines of life before going back off into the dark of the night.",

For updates, follow us on Instagram . Theme: All Things Autumn For our third meet-up, we will be taking a slightly different approach by working on a theme instead of a specific art. So, whether you are looking to paint a piece, collage, crochet a beanie, or make yourself a bracelet...draw inspiration from the crisp, cool air and colorful leaves around to create your masterpiece. Green Easel Art Club meetings are potluck style, so we bring supplies and are willing to share with others. Don't panic if you don't have any art supplies; the organizer will be getting some (limited supply). The art club is open to all skill levels. You will have the opportunity to create whatever you'd like, either alone or even together with someone. Some reference art books and images will be available if you need inspiration. You can follow your intuition, ask a club member to show you a technique, or even work on any other art project beyond what is mentioned above (remember to bring relevant supplies or let me know in advance so I can look into arranging supplies for you)! Bring snacks, water, sunscreen, and a picnic blanket (unless you are comfortable sitting directly on the grass). Plus-ones are encouraged; register for the event accordingly. In case you cannot make it, cancel your ticket so we have the right headcount. As always, I look forward to meeting under the trees and crafting away the fall afternoon. Once I find a cozy spot for us by the Belvedere Castle, I will share an exact pin location on the day. Be sure to follow @greeneaselclub.nyc on Instagram for updates, and read our rules below. - Hate and bigotry are not tolerated. - Be open to sharing supplies. If you bring something you don't wish to share, no problemkeep it near you or let people know politely. - Treat art supplies and the space with love and leave no trace behind. - Keep track of your belongings. Green Easel Art Club is not responsible for items left behind. We will round up anything left and let folks know. Please ensure you follow up if you want to collect it. Please note that all attendees consent to being photographed and videoed, which may be used for marketing or promotional purposes. We will try our best to keep it to a minimum. :)",

Credits are available for both virtual and in-person attendees. This years Ecological Plant Conference at Wave Hill on Friday, October 25 will feature four incredible speakers, each with a unique perspective and stories to share about working with plants. The Ecological Plant Conference is always a deep dive into the world of plants in the built landscape and this year's program is sure to inspire you to learn more about the plants around you. Speakers include: Ethan Dropkin - Larry Weaner Landscape Associates Educated in Landscape Architecture and Horticulture at Cornell University, Ethan Dropkin has taken an inborn love of plants since childhood and followed that to a career in landscape design with a focus in native plants and landscapes at Larry Weaner Landscape Associates and lecturing on horticulture and plants at large. Ethan has a particular love of plants (and plant communities) that thrive in difficult conditions and how those plants and assemblages can be adapted to horticultural practice to solve some of our most difficult planting issues. When not designing or lecturing he is an avid contributor to citizen science projects like eBird and iNaturalist and is a loving father and husband. Tama Matsuoka Wong - Meadows and More Tama Matsuoka Wong is a forager, weed eater, wild farmer, and meadow doctor. She is the author of the backyard field guide and cookbook Foraged Flavor (Clarkson Potter June 2012), nominated for a James Beard award in 2013, followed by Scraps, Wilt & Weeds with Chef Mads Refslund (winner of IACP award for Food Matters) and now Into the Weeds: How to Garden Like a Forager . After graduating from Harvard Law School and serving more than 25 years as a financial services lawyer in Tokyo, New York, and Hong Kong, Tama returned with her family to Hunterdon County, New Jersey and rediscovered her passion for the natural world. In 2007, she was named Steward of the Year by the New Jersey Forest Service. Arden Pontasch - North Creek Nurseries Arden Pontasch is the Plant Trials Manager at North Creek Nurseries, a wholesale propagation nursery with a strong emphasis on Eastern US native plants and their cultivars.

Arden holds a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies from the University of Toledo, Ohio, and has dedicated herself to the Green Industry (with experience in both private and public sectors) for almost 20 years. Above all, Arden is passionate about connecting people with nature, which has led her on a path of exploring plants, human culture, and their role in shaping the world around us. Evan Abramson - Landscape Interactions Evan Abramson grew up amongst the museums and parks of New York City, where early exposure to ancient art, cultures, animals and plants left lasting impressions upon his abilities to create and organize images, color, light and form. Drawing on his diverse experience as a regional planner, landscape designer, farmer, community organizer, filmmaker and photojournalist, Evan designs landscapes and corridors that build biodiversity and resilience to a changing climate at the ecosystems level. As Founder and Principal of Landscape Interactions, he works closely with project partners along every step of the process, from conception through design, implementation and maintenance. Under his leadership, Landscape Interactions has been responsible for designing over 350 acres of installed habitat across the Northeast.

IV nutrition works by increasing the blood concentration of various essential vitamins, branch chain amino acids, and minerals that is greater than can be bioavailable through oral supplements. These therapies are becoming well accepted and offer physicians new tangible revenue streams while allowing delegation of these procedures as well as increased patient care for good health. IV Nutrition therapies are very popular and have many benefits to patients who suffer from a number of absorption and immune disorders. Empire has developed this 1-Day course to concentrate on the readily available IV Nutrition products commercially available (i.e. Myers Cocktail) as well as modifications to the various IV nutrition products for a number of symptoms your patients will benefit from. Almost anyone can benefit from these types of Nutritional IV therapies. Candidates for these procedures include patients that are healthy overall but may want increased energy or have other non-medical related symptoms. IV nutrition increases bio-availability of these nutrients as well as temporarily boost metabolic activity at the cellular level so energy is manufactured at a higher rate and is more efficient.

Join us on November 7th in Austin for networking and discussions about the future of nuclear in Texas.

The American Conservation Coalition (ACC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to mobilizing young people around environmental action through common-sense, pro-innovation, and limited-government principles. ACC was founded in 2017 by a group of young conservatives who wanted to fill the ideological gap in the environmental movement that was preventing effective, durable action. You can learn more about ACC at acc.eco The Texas Nuclear Alliance is the only industry association in Texas dedicated to the advancement of nuclear technology in the state. TNA was formed with a singular mission: to make Texas the Nuclear Capital of the World. Formed in 2022 in the aftermath of Winter Storm Uri, TNA is based on the fundamental premise that if Texas and the world want low-carbon, reliable energy, it can no longer turn its back on nuclear energy. Nuclear is clean, safe, reliable, and secure. TNA is hosting the inaugural Texas Nuclear Summit this November in Austin, TX.

        "summary": "A gathering of women, for women Our Sacred Womens Circle welcomes all ages and brings together the generations. These sacred gatherings give women a safe space to connect, share, celebrate, and empower. When we participate in a womens circle, we carry on the tradition of our female ancestors by forming a sacred community guided by the feminine energy to allow each woman to feel safe, held, heard without judgment, connected, and empowered. Why join? How often do we have space to speak without being interrupted? How often do we have permission to just be quiet and listen? How often do we get the opportunity to share our burdens without being told what we \"should\" do to fix it? How often are we able to share our happiness and triumphs without being viewed as cocky or conceited? How often do we take the time to step away from our families and responsibilities to take care of ourselves & fill our own cups? When we sit in a womens circle, we connect and support sisterhood in a safe space. Our Sacred Womens Circle gives each woman a chance to speak their truth without judgment. When we allow ourselves to be vulnerable with supportive, empowering women, it releases the weight of our burdens. We shed light on our fears, thus, diminishing their power. We talk through our stressors and into creative solutions. We can then step beyond the wall of fear, and into the freedom of our strength. It's a place to build community. Society has often found ways to break apart the sacred bonds between women. A womens circle reminds sisters to treat each other as allies, rather than competition. To look at each other and see the unique wisdom & gifts we each carry in our own experiences, our own traumas, our own lives. We allow ourselves to be open, vulnerable, authentic, raw, thus allowing the women surrounding us to do the same. We offer a touch point. A solid rock to come back to for stability and support. We laugh, share our joy, and celebrate each other's wins as a collective. We hold space for each other in times of need and we embrace one another without question. It is a moment for self-care. Women play essential roles in society. They are mothers, wives, aunts, sisters, daughters, partners, friends. They uphold positions of power & guide future generations of females to pursue their dreams. They are the queens of multi-tasking, leading both their families and their communities simultaneously. Often our busy lives get in the way of spending precious time on self-care. Our Sacred Womens Circle is a moment for self-love. It gives us permission to take time to nurture ourselves. A chance to pause, take a moment, and ask ourselves, \"What do I need?\" Being a part of a circle of women offers a time to rest, to connect with sisters, and focus on physical, spiritual, and mental wellbeing. Its a time to celebrate the divine feminine, to encourage originality and uniqueness in our sisters, and let your authentic Self shine!",

A Death Caf is a group-directed discussion of death with no preset agenda, objectives or themes. It is a discussion group rather than a grief support or counselling session, and not affiliated with any specific faith or belief system. At a Death Caf people, often strangers, gather to eat treats and discuss death. Our objective is 'to increase awareness of death with a view to helping people make the most of their (finite) lives'.

        "summary": "Out in Tech Houston provides an inclusive networking space for LGBTQ+ people and allies working in tech. About this event Join our relaxed, social-mixer event, hosted on the second Thursday of every month. This is the first year we are hosting our monthly mixer at The Ion, and we hope to have many more! Parking and getting there is tricky, so we've provided detailed information below. NOTE: Please be aware that we've recently lost one of our Leadership Team members and will be using our September Mixer as a time to celebrate his life and accomplishments in our community. About Out in Tech We are a non-profit that unites the LGBTQ+ tech community around the world. We do this by creating opportunities for our 40,000 members worldwide to advance their careers, grow their networks, and leverage tech for social change. We envision a tech industry where LGBTQ+ people are empowered, well-represented, and have full agency, from intern to CEO. We're looking forward to meeting you! RSVP and save the date in your calendars for an evening you cannot miss. ------- Out in Tech is the worlds largest non-profit community of LGBTQ+ tech leaders. Connect with 20k LGBTQ+ tech professionals in our Slack channel . Each local chapter (and many virtual ones) provides opportunities for folks to engage with us and each other. Our events educate and inspire with panels, career events, and more. If you have felt inspired and supported by these events, please consider supporting our work by making a donation to Out in Tech . Note: Out in Tech's Code of Conduc t applies to all our spaces, online and IRL. Photographs may be taken at this event. Please notify someone at check-in if you prefer not to be photographed. Need to reach out to OIT staff? Email houston@outintech.com (we promise we check it) ------- Getting to The Ion Second Draught is located on the first floor of The Ion. Getting to the building can be a bit tricky, so we've laid out some important details to keep in mind as you plan your arrival. You can also visit https://iondistrict.com/visit/getting-here/ for more information. Uber/Lyft/Rideshare Enter 4201 Main Street, Houston, TX 77002 into the destination address field in your rideshare app. However, you won't be dropped off and enter the building on Main Street. Instead, you'll enter the building at the east entrance, on Fannin Street. This is because the Metro light rail Red line runs along Main Street, and for safety, most rideshare apps direct the driver to drop passengers off on the other side of the building on Fannin Street. (See the map below.) Driving and Parking There are several parking options at The Ion. Red parking lot: This is a surface lot and is the best option because parking is free for the first 3 hours. (And the event is only scheduled for 1.5, so you're in the clear.) Enter 4203 Fannin Street, Houston, TX 77004 into your GPS for directions to the Red parking lot. There are no parking attendants, and the system does not issue physical tickets or receipts for parking. Simply drive in; the gate will open automatically, or prompt payment upon exit. The system captures images of vehicles upon entry and exit to manage access and payments. Please note that only debit and credit card payments are accepted. Yellow parking lot : This is also a surface lot and adheres to the same policies as the Red parking lot. However, we were advised that they often fill up quickly because they also offer valet service. Valet service is only $5 (not bad), and if you wish to park in the Yellow parking lot, enter 4200 Fannin Street, Houston, TX 77004 into your GPS. Pink parking lot (The Ion District Parking Garage): This is covered parking in a deck with elevators. This is not advised because parking is only free for 2 hours and it's a bit of a walk from the main Ion building. If you must have covered parking and don't mind walking, enter 4111 Fannin Street, Houston, TX 77004 into your GPS. Green parking lot: This is the surface parking lot for Greentown Labs, one block away from The Ion. Please do not park in this lot, even if the gates are open. Public Transit Take the Red Line Metrorail light rail and get off at the Wheeler station , located one block south at 4590 Main Street, Houston TX 77002. Trains run every 6 minutes.",

Join us on Saturday, October 26, 2024 at 11:00 AM at the beautiful Embassy Suites by Hilton Houston Energy Corridor for a delightful afternoon filled with great food, entertainment, and networking opportunities. This event is the perfect chance to connect with fellow professionals and honor the EXcelevating Crown Jewels, domestic violence survivors who are as precious and invaluable as jewels in a crown, all within a sophisticated setting. Don't miss out on this special occasion to connect with other like-minded individuals in City Chic elegant attire of purple, gold, and/or black. Reserve your spot today and get ready for a memorable experience! \"The event's name, The Purple Reign Luncheon, was chosen for the historical significance of the color purple. In October 1987, the first Domestic Violence Awareness Month saw widespread adoption of purple clothing, a tradition that has since solidified purple as the color of domestic violence awareness. The color purple evolved from the earlier use of lavender by domestic violence organizations. 'Reign' reflects the luncheons highlight: the honoring of the EXcelevating Crown Jewels, domestic violence survivors who are precious and invaluable, like jewels in a crown. 'Luncheon' signifies the grandeur of the festive occasion with City Chic elegance serving as an extravagant gathering for our esteemed Crown Jewels to feast.\" Pre-Luncheon Festivities: An elegant Mimosa Network and Social Hour, an opportunity to mingle and connect. This gathering is perfect for those looking to expand their social circle and engage in meaningful conversations. A variety of small businesses will set up tables to showcase their products and services. Attendees can explore a diverse range of offerings. DJ Chromeblazin will spin smooth music while the ladies network, shop, take photos and 360 videos. Luncheon Speakers: Christina Allen, JD Christina Allen, Chief Executive Officer of FamilyTime Crisis and Counseling Center, has worked in the field of sexual assault prevention and education for over 25 years.

Previously, Allen has served as Director of Community Engagement and Executive Director of the Education Foundation for Spring ISD, Vice-President of Development for Prevent Blindness Texas and Manager of Corporate and Foundation Relations for the Houston Area Womens Center. Christina expect the organization to continue to be a valued resource in not just the community of Humble but even to go beyond that since we do serve individuals outside of just the area of Humble proper and to really become more of a strategic partner and a thought leader, not only when it comes to domestic violence and sexual assault but looking holistically at how people become empowered to improve their lives and have a better experience and become more self-sufficient so that they can really enjoy the best life possible for them. Lisa Evans, MBA Lisa Evans, a God-fearing single parent of five turned her trials into triumph through her faith, fortitude, and friendships.

About your Field Trip Leader: Luis \"Beto\" Matheus has always been interested in nature and wildlife. Even as a kid growing up in Venezuela, he always kept a copy of \"A Guide to the Birds of Venezuela\" by Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee and William H. Phelps (1978), the first bird field guide for any Latin American country, within reach. Yet he only became a \"serious\" birder around 2006 when he joined his father on a birding trip with Venezuela's Audubon Conservation Society to Yacamb National Park, at the northernmost edge of the eastern Andes. After seeing a male Golden-winged Manakin (Masius chrysopterus) take off in front of him in the cloud forest, he went home, bought a pair of binoculars and was hopelessly hooked...Turned into a fully-fledged bird nerd, Beto has been actively birding ever since, often with his birding parents, serving as a voluntary eBird reviewer for Venezuela since 2008 and joining several Audubon chapters as he moves around for work. A civil engineer working in renewable energy development, Beto has lived in Mexico (Mexico City and Pachuca), Colorado (Boulder) and, now Florida (Boca Raton) with his wife and two teenage kids.",

        "summary": "This monthly book club led by Doug Knowlton is for those who like to read and discuss poetry. It celebrates the integral role of poets and poetry in life and literature. Decembers selection is To 2040 , the visionary new poems of Jorie Graham's fifteenth poetry collection. We will meet in person in the loft at our store at The Mark, 117 S. Pineapple Ave. The book club is $22, which includes a copy of To 2040 to be picked up at Bookstore1 any time before our meeting. About the book: It is rare to find in one collection an entire skyline burning and the quiet to follow a single worm, to hear soil breathein Jorie Graham's fifteenth poetry collection, you do. Jorie Grahams fifteenth poetry collection, To 2040 , opens in question punctuated as fact: Are we / extinct yet. Who owns / the map. In these visionary new poems, Graham is part historian, part cartographer as she plots an apocalyptic world where rain must be translated, silence sings louder than speech, and wired birds parrot recordings of their extinct ancestors. In one poem, the speaker is warned by a clairvoyant the American experiment will end in 2030. Graham shows us our potentially inevitable future soundtracked by sirens among industrial ruins, contemplating the loss of those who inhabited and named them. In sparse lines that move with cinematic precision, these poems pan from overhead views of reshaped shorelines to close-ups of a worm burrowing through earth. Here, we linger, climate crisis on hold, as Graham asks us to sit silently, to hear soil breathe. An urgent open letter to the future, with a habit of looking back, To 2040 is narrated by a speaker who reflects on her own mortalityin the glass window of a radiotherapy room, in the first claw full of hair placed gently on a green shower ledge. In poems that look to 2040 as both future and event-horizon, we leave the collection warned, infinitely wiser, and yet more attentively on edge. Inhale. / Are you still there / the sun says to me. And, from the title poem, what was yr message, what were u meant to / pass on? Poet Jorie Graham was born in New York City, raised in Rome, and educated in France. Trilingual in English, Italian, and French, she studied philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris before attending New York University to study filmmaking. She holds an MFA in poetry from the University of Iowa and is the author of fifteen collections of poetry. Her work has been widely translated and she is the recipient of multiple honors including a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Fellowship, the International Nonino Prize, and most notably the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for \\ . Currently, Graham is the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard University. ...........................................................................................................

Join us as we bring together professionals from a dozen fields to celebrate building a better Florida for the next generation and explore the latest developments in one of the fastest growing cities in the United States. We'll garner key insights, lessons learned and effective approaches to New Urbanism against the backdrop of Tampa's rapidly redeveloping urban core. We'll tackle real-world challenges and solutions, share best practices, connect with peers, and learn from industry leaders who are implementing the principles of the new urbanism throughout Florida. The 2024 CNU Florida Summit is one you won't want to miss. Inspiration guaranteed. Summit Add Ons There are two tours and a training offered Wednesday, October 16 from noon to 1:30 p.m. before the Summit begins. There is an additional chage for these. There are three tour options on Friday, October 18 from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. These tours are offered at no additional charge; however, space is limits so we request that you select a free add on ticken when you register for the summit. Game of Zones Training: Hacking Comprehensive Plans and Zoning to Achieve Walkable Urbanism A hands-on session on how to run a zoning code stress test to demonstrate the barriers to Missing Middle Housing. Places seeking more housing choices are often stymied by their existing land development code requirements regarding lot size, parking minimums, setbacks, frontage, and lot coverage. We will examine a conventional, Euclidean code as participants try to try to create a missing middle building type on a traditional, urban lot. (Hint its not on a cul de sac) Drawing skill is not necessary for this exercise, as the lot, a scale, parking spaces, and various missing middle housing types will be provided for participants to arrange. An additional exercise will address the question of whether the building can meet the financial requirements for construction to determine where the barriers to development lie. The Game of Zones Training is offered before the Summit. The cost is $20 with a Summit registration or $65 without a Summit registration. Hotel Information A block of rooms is reserved at the Hotel Tampa Riverwalk. Reservations can be made online or via telephone at 1-800-774-1500. The group code is 91D.",

        "summary": "Welcome to the registration page for the 12th Integrated Mathematical Oncology (IMO) workshop at the Moffitt Cancer Center. Now in its 12th year we are supported by our recent grant from the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium (CSBC) on the Delta Ecology of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and the Moffitt Cancer Center of Excellence for Evolutionary Therapy (CoE). The IMO workshop is designed to motivate and facilitate a hands-on modeling experience focused on understanding and reducing treatment toxicity. The workshop is comprised of both an educational event and competition and divides participants into multiple teams combining clinical, experimental and theoretical members. These teams integrate their energies to develop and implement a mathematical model focussed on treatment toxicity to facilite treatment discussions across a range of cancers. The teams are expected to come up with a model, solve it and give a presentation all within 4.5 intense days. As always, we will have several independent judges to view both the specific aims and the closing presentations to decide the winning team. To facilitate integration and motivate participation we are offering an Amazon gift voucher to active participants of the winning team and to the runner up team. In addition, to facilitate further development of the winning project we are offering a $50K pilot grant (generously funded by Moffitt Cancer Center) to the leaders of the winning team. As with last years workshop there will be a \"speed dating for scientists\" to break the ice among diverse group of participants on the 3rd. The opening presentation on the 4th will summarize what is expected of the teams and serve to motivate the subsequent hands on model development sessions. We plan to have a separate poster session on the evening of the 4th to allow participants to showcase their own research. Participation in the workshop requires registration in order to generate the teams and give numbers for the food and beverages we are providing throughout the workshop. We are offering deluxe travel awards for external participation!!! Each award will cover flight + accommodation + meals for up to 6 nights and allow for both national and international scientists to participate in this unique hands on educational event. If you are either a PhD student, Postdoctoral student or junior faculty with a passion for research and a desire to better understand the role of cancer evolution in shaping therapeutic strategies as well as how to build integrated models then please apply during the registration process. Please note: the travel awards are extremely limited and will be offered on a competitive basis, application does not guarantee participation. If you are able to cover your own expenses, please indicate this during the registration process. Please note TRAVEL AWARD APPLICATIONS WILL BE CLOSING ON Wendesday the 2nd of October 2024 at 5pm EST. AWARD WINNERS WILL BE CONTACTED before the 7th of October 2024. What Moffitt Cancer Center under the auspices of the Center for Evolutionary Therapy has been developing evolutionary therapies with the goal to control cancer rather than eradicate it. Across multiple clinical trials this has led to a significant decrease in the amount of time patients are on treatment. As a result treatment driven toxicity has significantly decreased. Currently most cancer treatments only react to toxicity effects and are consistently given at the maximum tolerable dose. Mathematical models of cancer treatment rarely consider toxicity effects and if they do its often through surrogates such as cumulative drug dose. Toxicity impacts many normal homeostatic processes and can be especially harmful to a patients immune system and have long terms impact on heart health, brain health and even drive the emergence of secondary cancers. A question we hope the teams will tackle is how to best balance toxicity and efficacy for treatment of an evolving cancer ? This motivates many more questions: (i) How should toxicity be modelled? (ii) Are drug holidays or drug sequences better for toxicity control? (iii) How long do toxicity effects persist for a given treatment? (iv) Which drugs are the least toxic, would dose reduction help? Therefore, the ambitious focus of this year's workshop is to try, in under week, to come up with novel therapuetic strategies, across a number of cancers, with the explicit goal of reducing toxicity but maintaining efficacy. When Sunday, 6PM, 3rd November 2024 - Friday 2PM, 8th November 2024. Where Speed dating: SRB Atrium, 6PM 3rd November. Intoductory presentation: SRB Murphey, 9AM 4th November. Poster session: TBD, 7PM 4th November. Working group sessions: Various rooms, 4th November - 7th November. Closing presentations: SRB Murphey, 9AM 8th November.

We originally started on our sizeable Discord server during the pandemic and have since expanded into a monthly meetup and munch, quickly becoming one of the biggest in LA! The LA Kinky Weirdos Munch is not a play party but a large gathering at the beautiful bar/restaurant The Trophy Wife in Silverlake! We host on the outside patio as we try to be covid-conscious. If you're worried about being an introvert, you'll be in good company! Everyone who comes to this event is eager to meet new people. LA Kinky Weirdos was created out of a desire for a more thoughtful and inclusive space for kinksters to socialize. Created by a black transgender woman, LAKW prides itself on being the kind of event where the full diversity of our community is on full display! Come as yourself! We are an entertaining and often fashionable bunch, so this year, we wanted to have monthly prompts to add more fun! It's not required, just fun.

We respect that rules around vaccinations have been lifted for public gatherings, but we want to protect those in our community who are more vulnerable to the virus. Out of respect for those people and our community, please only come to the event if youve been vaccinated. You must be 18+ to attend this event. Please keep your attire vanilla. We are a group of very fashionable folks, but we do not want to draw unwanted attention to our group. Please do not, for example, walk your submissive in on leash. Respect the boundaries and consent of others. Just because this is a kink-positive space does not mean everyone in this space is comfortable with touch or the rapid assumption of familiarity. Do not touch, grope or in any way molest someone without their consent. Additionally, keep any that does happen to a minimum. This is still not a kink party and still a very public venue where children are occasionally present. A lcohol Consumption is for people who are 21+ only. Our current venue is a restaurant and a bar, meaning people under the age of 18 are technically allowed at the venue. However, alcohol consumption is still illegal for those under the age of 21. We are in good standing with the venue and we do not want to risk that by allowing or covering underage drinking. If you are under the age of 21 and over the age of 18, you are allowed to come to our munch, but you will be asked to leave if we catch you consuming alcohol. Those who provide the alcohol will also be asked to leave as well. Providing and consuming alcohol illegally at this event is grounds for removal from our community. Please respect this rule. If youve been banned from our community, you are also banned from our events. While you do not need to be part of our server to attend this event, if youve been banned from our server, you are also banned from our in-person events and will be asked to leave. Generally speaking, if youve been banned from our server, youve done something particularly heinous or violated someone in some way. We do not want that energy around our in-person gatherings Respect the boundaries and consent of others.

        "summary": "Welcome to Yellow Church Chat: Windsor Neighbors Discussions ! This new series seeks to connect Windsor neighbors over issues that affect us in a civil, welcoming and constructive way. Each meeting will feature a local expert on a topic, as well as the chance to ask questions and learn from each other. Our inaugural Yellow Church Chat will be with Deva Marie Proto , who has the very long title of Clerk-Recorder-Assessor-Registrar of Voters. She will talk a bit about how elections work and we can ask questions. This in-person event is a great opportunity to connect with your neighbors, share ideas, and engage in meaningful conversations. Don't miss out on this chance to be a part of our vibrant community! See you there! Some quick answers you may have: 1) Why is it called the \"Yellow Church Chat?\" The friendly and neighborhood-minded pastor at Windsor Presbyterian Church is graciously hosting these meetings in the historic church off the Windsor Town Green. Which church? It's the Yellow Church on the street. Hence, the name. 2) Is this a church meeting? Nope - it's a neighborhood meeting. You don't have to be a member of the church - or any church, synagogue, mosque, coven or temple - to attend. You just have to be willing to be polite and civil and enter with a positive attitude. 3) Who is organizing this? We are a group of Windor neighbors who want to see constructive civil discourse. Tim Zahner, a Windsor resident, is coordinating these along with Pastor Mary Beene and with input from the greater community, including the Windsor Chamber of Commerce. None of these organizations are \"sponsors\" and aren't endorsing any views presented, but rather hoping to facilitate positive civic discourse. 4) Can I help? Yes - we don't know how yet, but if you want to help, let us know. Maybe we'll need help with snacks, or ideas, or publicity. Let us know!",

Psychedelic Culture 2025 will continue our tradition of exploring cutting-edge themes that are largely absent from the mainstream psychedelic conversation, related to our main initiatives: Indigenous Reciprocity & Decolonial Dialogues, Psychedelic Justice, Protection of Sacred Plants & Cultural Traditions, and voices from the Global South. At this two day in-person conference, with 3 simultaneous tracks, Chacruna will convene comprehensive panels and experiential opportunities that will foster conversations around topics including: Indigenous voices, Indigenous reciprocity, biocultural conservation, religion and psychedelics, holding mindful ceremony, legislation reform, law and policy, racial equity and access, queering psychedelics, women in psychedelics, veteran leaders in psychedelics, disabled populations and psychedelics, perspectives from the Global South, critical reflections on psychedelic science, including psychedelic assisted therapy, sexual abuse, touch and ethics, and dialogues between neuroscience and shamanism. We will also offer a space for participation in music, dance, art circles, rap (tobacco) ceremonies and affinity meet up groups. Chacrunas interdisciplinary conferences are well known for bringing diverse voices together, combining intellectual vision and rigor, community, activism, heart and soul. In the midst of the so called psychedelic renaissance, it is more important than ever to promote dialogues between scientists and communities who have been truly involved with these medicines, to have knowledge about the proper ways to use and steward them.

While Germany offers advanced solar technology and practical insights from existing projects, California combines vast agricultural land with an unbeatable entrepreneurial spirit. Transatlantic Collaboration and best-practice-sharing can boost the sustainable growth of the Agrivoltaics industry. Building on the lasting achievements of last years conference, we will host the premier platform for Agrivoltaics in California again to foster knowledge exchange, connect all relevant stakeholders, and strengthen collaboration to move Agrivoltaics from niche-innovation to mainstream markets. Here are some key questions that we will tackle: How can agrivoltaic systems be designed to maximize both solar energy production and agricultural yield? What are the environmental benefits and potential barriers to develop solar on agricultural land? What are sustainable business models that deliver value to all agrivoltaics stakeholder groups (from farmers to communities and the solar industry) in a manner that is both economically sustainable and environmentally sound? Legal framework and incentives to move Agrivoltaics from niche-innovation to mainstream markets? What does it take to move Agrivoltaics to scale? During #CGAV23, 200+ attendees engaged in discussions on various topics with 20+ expert speakers. The upcoming #CGAV24 intends to delve deeper into these subjects and complement the insights with a field trip, showcasing real-life agrivoltaic examples for a comprehensive understanding. The objective is to foster robust German-American collaborations, propelling the flourish-ing market of agrivoltaics.",

Conference Speakers and topics: Brad Biagini Vice President, Technology Renovo Recources, LLC. Beneficial Reuse of Oilfield Produced Water Join us for a presentation focused on the beneficial reuse of produced water. We will explore Renovo's partnership with a prominent California-based oil company in Kern County, aimed at treating oilfield-produced water to achieve beneficial reuse quality. By transforming this resource, not only is a reliable source of freshwater suitable for irrigation generated, but Class II injection volumes are also substantially reduced. Discover how this collaboration is transforming the oil, water, and agricultural sectors!

Lorelei Oviatt Director, Kern County Planning & Natural Resource Department Kern County Builiding the Carbon Management Future What will it take to expand Kern County's economy to new types of carbon management industries ?New companies are interested but will past success with wind and solar, green investment funding and engineering expertise be enough? Hear from the Director of Kern County Planning and Natural Resources on the opportunities and challengesof not just designing the future, but making it happen by 2034. Yasmeen Sultana Chief Operating Officer, Spheros Environmental Evolving Landscape of Methane Regulation in Californias Oil and Gas Sector (2024) Methane regulation in Californias oil and gas sector has become increasingly complex with existing and emerging requirements. While there have been several regulations for decades to control volatile organic compounds (VOCs), additional regulations to control methane and VOCs have been emerging over the past decade at various federal, state, and local agencies. Navigating these regulations to understand requirements is itself a significantly challenging task for oil and gas operators. What is more daunting is the fast-evolving nature of these regulations combined with the emerging multifaceted technological landscape, making the implementation of compliance programs extremely difficult. The California Air Resources Boards (CARB) adopted the California Oil and Gas Rule (COGR) in 2017 to address methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. COGR introduced requirements that were mostly beyond the local air district regulations, and jointly implemented by CARB and the air districts. It was amended last year in 2023 to meet the US EPAs State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements and to add requirements to find and fix leaks using advanced technology, i.e. satellite-detected leaks. However, CARB is already proposing to amend COGR again to align with the US EPAs Emissions Guidelines that were released towards the end of last year. This discussion will outline each of the drivers, potential changes to COGR in this latest round of amendments, potential impacts, feedback received by CARB, and timelines. Lisa Beckham Control Measures Manager, US EPA Region 9 Air & Radiation Division Regulatory Updates: PM2.5 NAAQS; EPA Sec. 111[d] (power plants, oil & gas); CARB's Oil & Gas Regulation Lisa Beckham is the manager of the Control Measures Section in the EPA Region 9 Air & Radiation Division. Lisa has been working at EPA since 2011 and has extensive experience with Clean Air Act permitting programs and with air pollution control technologies. Prior to EPA, Lisa worked for the Kentucky Department of Environmental Protection and has a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Kentucky.

In 1973, he established Vanderbyl Design, working across the spectrum of print, digital, interiors and product design. In 1987, he was elected to the Alliance Graphique Internationale (AGI); in 2000, he received the AIGA Medal and in 2012, was inducted into Interior Design Magazines Hall of Fame. Michael received the Lifetime Achievement Titan Award from the International Interior Design Association (IIDA) in 2014. As an educator, Michael acted as Dean of the School of Design at California College of the Arts (CCA), as well as teaching for over thirty years. Michael continues to practice, working with many of his long-standing clients as well as new clients in the luxury furniture, real estate, and wine industries. Michael Schwab From his studio in Marin County, Michael Schwab has established a reputation as one of Americas most recognized and best loved graphic artists. Originally from Oklahoma, Michael attended school in Texas and New York before graduating from Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles. Michael has a broad array of visual, cultural and geographic references to which he regularly turns for ideas most often from the American West. He has created award-winning logos and posters for a remarkable list of prestigious clients, including Apple, Levis, the National Park Service, Major League Baseball, Polo Ralph Lauren, Robert Redford and the San Francisco Opera. His work is striking in its simplicity. Michael Mabry Michael Mabry, graphic designer/illustrator was born in Michigan and raised in a suburb 30 miles south of downtown Chicago, Illinois. During the final semester of his senior year in high school, fulfilling a compulsory credit in art to graduate, he became aware of the power and the joy of creating. This initiated his lifelong journey to discover a career in the Arts. He headed west first to study at Iowa State University, then at the University of Utah to earn a Bachelor of Arts in 1978. Finally moving to San Francisco where he had the extreme good fortune to work for Nicholas Sidjakov and Jerry Berman. Sidjakovs mastery of illustration and typography and Bermans conceptual acumen left an indelible impression on Mabrys approach to his craft. With a modest loan from his soon to be bride he began his design business in 1981 with a lot of bright-eyed ambition, Midwestern temperament, and limitless energy. His approach of blending design and illustration has evolved over the years although his goal of touching the viewer with a bit of humanistic charm has remained a constant. In 2014 he closed the business of 33 years to pursue personal interests. His work is included in the permanent collections of the Library of Congress, SFMOMA, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Hong Kong Heritage Museum and the Center for Political Graphics. Maurice Woods Maurice Woods, a graduate of the University of Washington with a BFA and MFA in Visual Communication Design, has made significant strides in the design industry, transitioning from a professional basketball career to prominent roles at Pentagram Design, Yahoo!, and currently, Microsoft. With over 25 years of experience, he has earned accolades such as the AIGA SF Design Fellow Award and the Jefferson Award for Public Service. As the Executive Director and Founder of the globally recognized nonprofit Inneract Project, Maurice has dedicated two decades to empowering Black, Latinx, and other underrepresented communities through free design education. The organization offers a comprehensive curriculum that supports these communities from middle school to early career stages. In addition to his nonprofit work, Maurice teaches design courses, lectures internationally, and contributes to media like the Wall Street Journal and Fast Company. His contributions are also featured in the international film Design Disruptors and the Netflix documentary Bad Sport. John Mattos John Mattos, an artist residing on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco, lives just half a block west of the iconic Coit Tower. His hillside home offers sweeping views of landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island, which have profoundly influenced his work. Johns notable contributions include the artwork for the Preserve Coit Tower initiative and the 75th-anniversary poster for the Golden Gate Bridge. His creative talents extend to the Save the Rock campaign for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. John has garnered Gold and Silver Medals from prestigious institutions like The New York Society of Illustrators, Los Angeles Society of Illustrators, and the San Francisco Society of Illustrators.

        "summary": "BLUETECH WEEK: EVENT OVERVIEW As one of the first ocean and water technologies clusters in the U.S., TMA BlueTech is known for being at the forefront of advancing sustainable and responsible ocean and water technologies through innovation and collaboration. One of the ways we do this is by hosting pioneering events that bring together diverse minds from various sectors and silos to drive technological advancements, both the foreseen and unforeseen. BlueTech Week is TMAs annual flagship event. This is not just another large-scale conference; it is a smaller, more intimate event that is known for bringing together highly diverse technologies and knowledge sets with a high concentration of key decision-makers. This aggregation ensures that BlueTech Week offers unparalleled opportunities for highest-quality interactions that lead to positive commercial outcomes. This year, BlueTech Week is innovating yet again by exploring the powerful intersection between maritime defense, maritime decarbonization, and ocean resilience technologies. We invite you to join us on this groundbreaking journey, which has high positive-impact potential for not only ocean and coastal ecosystem worldwide, but for high-value commercial opportunities in these three sectors as well. PART 1: BLUETECH SUMMIT & EXPO (November 18-20) Theme: Uniting Maritime Defense and Decarbonization Part 1 of BlueTech Week will explore the unique opportunities at the intersection of maritime defense and maritime decarbonization-related technologies. The event will bring together a diverse group of industry leaders, policymakers, international stakeholders and active duty officers uner the U.S. Department of Defense to discuss the future of innovation and environmental stewardship in the maritime sector. Participants will engage in dynamic conversations about policy frameworks, technology integration, and how best to leverage these synergies for commercial opportunities. Attendees will gain insights into cutting-edge technologies that enhance naval operations while minimizing environmental impact, including dual-use innovations that bridge defense and commercial applications. Additionally, the event will highlight collaborative initiatives focused on decarbonization, with a particular emphasis on aligning sustainability goals with defense readiness. This gathering also serves as a platform for exploring cross-border partnerships, featuring international perspectives that showcase how global collaboration can accelerate advancements in both maritime defense and decarbonization technologies. From policy discussions to investment strategies, Part 1 will provide actionable takeaways for stakeholders looking to drive innovation and achieve a more sustainable future for the maritime industry. Key Highlights of Part 1 Defense-Driven Decarbonization : Attendees will explore how defense initiatives are leading the charge in decarbonization technologies, with a focus on innovations that enhance naval operations while reducing carbon emissions and environmental impact.

        "summary": "Divine Feminine Healing & Empowerment Ceremony Join us for this women's psychic energy healing ceremony. Develop intimate awareness of your innate ability to heal yourself using the power of your multidimensional intuition. Facilitated by intuitive energy healer and ascension guide, Hannah Bourke, the Divine Feminine Healing and Empowerment ceremonies are devoted to guiding you on a deep journey within yourself. Each ceremony is uniquely focused to guide you in gracefully releasing unconsciously held limiting beliefs, ancestral and personal trauma, and begin to deeply un-wind patterns of co-dependency and unworthiness as you are guided in calling home your own sovereign spiritual energy and life force back into your body, mind, and Spirit with ease. These ceremonies are devoted to holding you in an immaculate energetic container of sacred safety as you are guided ever more deeply into the power of your psyche, soul, and somatic wisdom. Reconnect with your internal radiance as you bravely shine a light on the spaces within yourself calling out to be witnessed, felt, and integrated, so that you may step deeper into the fullness of who you are as a sovereign creative being embodied in your direct connection to Source. This ceremony includes guided self-healing meditation, psychic development training, group sharing, and sound healing. This space is open to women who want to explore and deepen their intuitive self-healing abilities together in community. All are welcome, whether you have explored spiritual healing arts or you are new to the healing path. The Divine Feminine is an energetic principle connected to intuition. We all hold a balance of both feminine and masculine energies within ourselves, and my intention with these ceremonies is to help awaken and empower our ability to trust this potent connection to our internal intuitive guidance system as the clearest pathway to living in alignment with our true self. Our intuition is connected to the wisdom of our soul and the light of God/Source/Universal Consciousness. The more we learn to listen to its whisper, trust the flow of information guiding our awareness, and set healthy boundaries to protect our energy and truth, the more we align with the path of our Higher Self, soul, and highest creative potential in this lifetime. In this ceremony, we will explore profound psychic development training that empowers your awareness about the spiritual technology of your aura and chakras and how to maintain a clean, clear energetic field as you go deep within yourself to heal on every level. Every ceremony begins with welcoming in the spiritual support from Divine Feminine Ascended Masters who are available to you in every present moment as mentors on your journey as you remember how to fully embody your own sovereign divine feminine intuitive healing and creative abilities. Please wear comfortable clothes, have some tea or water nearby, and perhaps a journal to further process your experience after the ceremony closes. The Divine Feminine Healing and Empowerment Ceremony will be held on Thursday, October 24th, at The Fairfax Community Church from 7-9 pm. Please arrive ten to fifteen minutes early to settle into the space gracefully so we may start the ceremony on time. A sage blessing and anointing with Blue Lotus oil will be available for you upon your arrival to welcome you into the ceremony space. Divine Feminine Healing & Empowerment Ceremony Thursday, October 24th 7-9pm The Fairfax Community Church 2398 Sir Francis Drake Blvd, Fairfax, CA 94930 The energy exchange for this ceremony is sliding scale between $50-$100 and is intended to be a sincere investment in your own self-healing and heartfelt spiritual empowerment. Please contact the facilitator at SacredLightAlchemy@gmail.com with any questions about financial needs and any other questions. About the Facilitator: Hannah Bourke is a trained clairvoyant psychic, intuitive energy healer, Reiki Master, and devotional musician. Her spiritual awakening unfolded over many years after seeing visions of the Divine Mother and receiving messages about a coming time of great change on this planet. She has devoted herself to learning/remembering how to heal herself so that she could be of service to others with her gifts during this shift as we ascend from a wounded ego-based consciousness into the embodiment of our Higher-Self soul consciousness. She primarily works with people one-on-one as an intuitive guide and energy healer who mentors others in developing alignment with their Higher Self and soul wisdom, and guides people on their embodied ascension journey through teaching multidimensional psychic development and intuitive self-healing as tools for self-liberation.

It has changed our life, our relationships, and we have witnessed first hand 1000's of other lives it has touched and awakened since then. Cathleene Cienfuegos is one of our most beloved friends who has been on the path of awakening since I met her! She started her Awaken as Love journey a few years later, but has dived into it fully, and is now a Lead Faculty, who teaches it all over the world! Who is ready to become more awake and aware in their body! More empowered and have fun doing it!? This is a special 1 night event for anyone who loves to move their energy though breath, movement, sound, and touch! In this taster you will discover the difference between waking up and growing up, and why both are important in the path of spiritual illumination. Why shadow work is a key component to empowering ourselves and the re-integration of important parts of us that may have been buried for years. All in all you may leave this evening with a new perspective on how you see the world and may wake up to a new purpose of the path you are currently on. This taster event gives an introduction to Awaken as Love and the four pillars of the Awaken as Love philosophy - a modern day Integral Mystery School that is at the cutting edge of evolution. Rooted in Tantra, Shamanism, Integral Theory (Neuroscience) & Biodanza their week-long Stage 1 training has been offered all around the world and transformed the lives of hundreds of people. It has been said that a quantum leap occurs in humans when they realize and embody the most recent unfolding edge of our consciousness named Integral Consciousness, and that it takes just 10% of the world population to steady themselves at this level to form a critical mass that will help bring the rest with them and that with that the solutions to most of the world's problems today reveal themselves. The Awaken as Love training is designed to jump start your expansion into this level with the mission of helping that 10% to emerge. In this taster you will discover the difference between waking up and growing up, and why both are important in the path of spiritual practice, why shadow work is key to empowering ourselves and to the re-integration of important parts of ourselves that we may have left behind. Embodied practices will be used to anchor key concepts and theory in ways that make sense to our daily lives. As we engage in deep communication connection exercises to bridge with one another's hearts. You will be held in a safe and supportive space by the Awaken as Love faculty. Cathleene Cienfuegos, Monique Darling and Peter Petersen are lead faculty and we are so excited to be collaborating in this movement we are all so passionate about!

Come ready to release those energies that hold you back from manifesting love.Come explore ways to experience more joy fully in your life. We will start the night with Latihan (a movement meditation for moving in the unknown)First let's talk a little but about how NOT moving in the unknown is one of the most costly, invisible limitations that sabotage our lives. Learning to move in the unknown is the OPPOSITE of being controlling. Its the opposite of needing to be Right. Practicing moving in the unknown is the medicine for holding your body in knots and tension in your abdomen, anxiety in your chest, and clenching in your root.Have you ever experienced any of those things? Latihan is the practice of surrender in the most pleasurable way. It can be a daily, weekly or monthly practice by your divine self or with a partner.After Latihan...let us lead you through a welcome circle where a room of strangers slowly opens up and winds up on the same page, having the opportunity to be seen, heard, and understood in ways maybe you have never even imagined!

We're wanting to bring the same energy to LA as soon as possible ** Come join us at Women of Color Los Angeles - Women Over Dinner. Our first in a series of quarterly dinners. We want to live in a world where the Inherent Power of Woman is remembered and expressed. The expressions will of course be as diverse as we are. Women Over Dinner is an invitation to gather and ask ourselves questions like: What does it mean, in present time, to be a woman? What if girls were taught from an early age, whether or not they ever choose to have a child, that they are born into nobility, a lineage that has the power to carry life and birth humans the lineage of Woman? Especially the nobility of women of color. Then, might we ask, is equality even our goal, or is it something else? Something deeper, something more than a reaction to what has been, but a creation of what is true? Women Over Dinner offers an insightful, just-edgy-enough guide to topics ripe for exploration: power, sexuality, and how both affect everything we see and experience in the world. And in this dinner in particular, the power, the sensuality of women of color, the conversations perhaps that are harder to have in mixed company. The dinner table, in its sacred simplicity, holds us. We invite you to gather friends, family, community, around a meal and have a personal and intimate conversation. Not the kind of conversation that goes sideways when cookie cutter political opinions tempt us towards divisiveness. Instead, a place to just share what you think, have experienced, and maybe most importantly, what you feel, as you break bread and listen. We have no doubt that what ripples out of these conversations can change the world. We are a nonprofit run on donations and the intention of every meal is that all women are welcome. Only give what you can. Any extra goes to another womans ticket and all proceeds go directly to the events we host. We are so excited to spend the evening with you. (Suggested donation is $50) Due to the intimate nature of the topics we explore, this event is for adults. You must be 18+. We check IDs at the door and require each guest sign a waiver prior to entering the event. This is a substance-free and alcohol-free event.",

He is known for his exuberant style and talent, and for a stage show that is unforgettable. A regular performer at various San Francisco clubs, Charles is an innovator in the genres of Jazz, R&B and World Beat. Charles, who plays alto, tenor and soprano saxophones, was deeply influenced by the seminal works of artists such as Coleman Hawkins, John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Grover Washington, Kenny Garrett and Lester Young, but has also drawn on a lifetime of experience playing with top level musicians the world over. Charles brings an undeniable sense of joy to his performances, with a smile that welcomes even the most recalcitrant listeners to the party, then proceeds to open up avenues of music that are enjoyable for the uninitiated and the aficionado alike. Charles Unger is a great player who loves what he is doing. Music for him is a spiritual mission and a quest for a kind of secular redemption that he has pursued since he was a child one that sustains him and has brought him a wealth of knowledge and experience.

        "summary": "FALL COLORS A DINNER BY CHEF SCOTT WINEGARD AT TIMELESS PRESENTED BY LAND AND SEA SATURDAY NOVEMBER 2nd. Timeless. Oakland California. LAND AND SEA & TIMELESS welcomes long time friend and Chef, Scott Winegard back to Oakland for our second collaboration- FALL COLORS. Scott will bring his years of cooking beautiful and delicious plant based menus to Oakland for this one night only event at Timeless. We will prepare a five-course plated and family style menu sourcing produce from our bountiful farms of California. Chloe Miller will be with us to pair natural wine sourced and produced with care. Joshua Wismans from The Crown is making a special Kombucha. Expect both communal and table seating. Maria Otero and Christopher Robin Duncan of LAND AND SEA are handbuilding ceramic plates for the dinner. As a gesture of gratitude for joining us, and to commemorate the occasion - guests will be given their plates to take with them as the night ends. ABOUT SCOTT WINEGARD: Scott Winegard is a maestro of flavor, seamlessly blending his passions for plant-based cuisine and culinary innovation into a symphony for the senses. Hailing from Long Island, NY, Scott's journey into the culinary world began unexpectedly, as he immersed himself in the punk rock and skateboarding scene of his youth. However, it was his serendipitous encounter with Angelica Kitchen, a local macrobiotic restaurant, that ignited his culinary flame. Under the mentorship of Leslie, the restaurant's owner, Scott honed his craft, learning the art of thoughtful, seasonal cooking sourced from local farms. His culinary prowess blossomed during his tenure at Angelica Kitchen, spanning nearly a decade, where he cultivated a deep-rooted commitment to fresh, vibrant cuisine. In the early 2000s, Scott delved into the pop-up dining scene, spearheading the exclusive and successful Brooklyn-based dinner club, Nasturtium. Simultaneously, he served as a private chef for esteemed clients in media, television, and fashion, further refining his culinary repertoire and forging lasting relationships. Scott's culinary journey took him across the globe, where he served as Executive Chef and Culinary Creative Director alongside Chef Matthew Kenney, a pioneering force in plant-based cuisine. Together, they collaborated on numerous projects, including the development and launch of over 25 restaurants, as well as co-authoring acclaimed cookbooks such as \"Plant Food\" and \"Plant Lab.\" In 2018, Scott embarked on a new chapter, assuming the role of Culinary Director, Executive Chef, and partner at a small restaurant in Portland, Oregon, where he championed his vision of seasonal, plant-based cuisine. Despite initial success, the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic prompted a pivot, leading Scott to part ways and seek solace in the sun-drenched landscapes of Carefree, Arizona. At Civana, a boutique wellness resort, Scott reignited his culinary passion, spearheading the reopening of food outlets and collaborating with Deepak Chopra's team on the Chopra Whole Health Retreat. However, the allure of Los Angeles beckoned, drawing Scott back into the fold of Matthew Kenney's culinary empire, where he lent his expertise to various high-profile projects and events. Now, in 2024, Scott finds himself returning to his roots in Brooklyn, poised to share his culinary wizardry through a myriad of private and public cooking events, consultations, and cooking classes. His illustrious career has been punctuated by accolades, from hosting a sold-out dinner at the James Beard House to being named Best Vegetable Restaurant in the US by We're Smart Green Guide. In addition to his culinary pursuits, Scott is eager to reignite his passion for music, embarking on long-talked-about music projects that have been simmering on the back burner. The harmonious blend of his culinary and musical talents promises to captivate audiences and enrich communities in new and exciting ways. Furthermore, Scott is thrilled to announce his collaboration with LAND AND SEA, an artist collective based in Oakland, California. Together, they will curate seasonal dinners that celebrate the bounty of the land, showcasing Scott's innovative approach to plant-based cuisine in conjunction with LAND AND SEA's incredible artist community. These collaborative dinners promise to be a feast for the senses, embodying the spirit of creativity, community, and culinary innovation. https://scottwinegard.com ABOUT CHLOE MILLER: Chloe Miller has been in the bar and restaurant industry for over a decade. She has curated several wine and cocktail menus with an emphasis on sustainability and accessibility within the community. ABOUT JOSHUA WISMANS: The Crowns Fermentation Lab is an adventurous side project of Joshua Wismans. Sparked by the allure of culinary fermentation and some excess equipment, what started as a fun experiment has turned into a full kombucha program fueled by seasonality and quality ingredients. ABOUT TIMELESS: As the only 100% plant-based coffee roastery and bakery since 2012, the Timeless mission has been to share the company's passion for great coffee and to expose customers to the positive benefits of being and eating vegan. Timeless products are all made in-house daily. Subculture, community, social awareness, and a general interest in being and doing better make up the rich fabric of the Timeless employees and customers alike. The company acts as a good steward not only in the coffee and food industry but for animals, people, and the planet. https://timelesscoffee.com ABOUT LAND AND SEA: LAND AND SEA is an independent publisher/record label and occasional project space based in Oakland California run by Maria Otero and Christopher Robin Duncan. For over a decade, LAND AND SEA has hosted shows, published books, records, tapes and zines that share, shed light and support images, sounds and ideas from a wide variety of artists. LAND AND SEA embodies lessons learned from an early education perpetuated by show flyers, music made in basements and VFW halls, stolen kinkos cards, photocopied zines, 12th generation mixed-tapes and 7\" records that intended to change the world. LAND AND SEA hope to amplify generally unheard and unseen efforts, adding to an ever-expansive, tactile, shared culture of print and sound ( and now dinners). LISTEN TO LYNC",

Defined by the European Commission as \"where the value of products, materials and resources is maintained in the economy for as long as possible, and the generation of waste is minimized,\" the circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from resource consumption. To achieve more sustainable development models and meet the 2050 Net-zero target, the EU launched a new Circular Economy Action Plan in 2020. The benefits of the circular economy extend beyond achieving climate goals and reducing resource consumption, it also enhances business profitability, creates new commercial opportunities, and improves supply chain resilience. The development of digital technologies provides essential support for achieving cradle-to-cradle cycles in the circular economy. Transforming the European economy into one that is cleaner and more competitive requires collaborative efforts across industries. This transformation must involve comprehensive and systematic changes, integrating ecological principles into design stages to minimize resource consumption and waste generation. It necessitates coordinated cooperation throughout the entire value chain. The summit aims to facilitate communication and learning among different industries and stakeholders in key areas crucial for advancing the circular economy. Participants will share new insights into achieving circular economy goals, strategies, and proven effective actions. It also serves as a high-quality platform for participants across the value chain to strengthen cooperation, exchange ideas, and explore new business opportunities. We Will Unite Thought Leaders, Policymakers And Innovators From Leading Global Companies To Discuss Hot Topics : Action on New Circular Economy Perspective from European Policies and Regulations . Unlock the Value of Circularity by Establishing Circular Business Models to Drive Economic Growth and Environmental Benefit .

Bei einem Kaffee, einen Keks in der Hand und beim \"Du\" fhrt man die besten Gesprche. Dort gibt es keine Rollenaufteilung in Sprecher:in / Zuhrer:in und die Themen finden sich ganz von selbst vor Ort oder Du bringst einfach welche mit, die Dir eventuell aktuell oder schon lange auf den Ngeln rund um Software Entwicklung, Software Architektur, Software Testing, Scrum, Projekt Managment, Requirements, IoT, Microservices, Patterns, Clean Code, TDD, BDD, JavaScript, .NET, Java, C, C++, Python, R, PHP, F#, TypeScript, Angular, React, Azure, AWS, Embedded, BigData, SQL, NoSql, Ci, CD ..... brennen. Auch wenn Du mal was Cooles vorstellen willst. Alles kein Problem. - Das ist die Idee vom #NOSSUED in Karlsruhe - Alle sind gleich! Auch die Organisatoren halten sich im Hintergrund und moderieren nur wenig. Der Teilnahme-Beitrag am #NOSSUED in Karlsruhe 2025 ist prinzipiell frei whlbar! Die Veranstaltung finanziert sich jedoch vornehmlich ber die Beitrge der Teilnehmer:innen. Ob 20, 30 , 50 , 100 oder mehr, entscheidest du vollkommen frei und selbst (Wegen Eventbrite muss es aber mindestens 1 Cent sein, da sonst die Anmeldung nicht funktioniert :o( ). Dein gespendeter Betrag fr das Ticket beinhaltet 19% Mehrwertsteuer! Du Bekommst mit der Anmeldung eine Rechnung inklusive Mehrwertsteuer. Die Eventbrite-Gebhren bernehmen wir.

The flagship event will focus on accelerating practical approaches to setting and implementing targets in areas including net zero, nature, impact, pollution, human rights, and financial inclusion to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. UNEP FIs biennial Global Roundtable (GRT) is a key event for driving action within the finance industry, offering thousands of professionals the chance to collaborate with peers and gain insights from global leaders. The GRT convenes a diverse group of stakeholders, including banks, insurers, investors, regulators, policymakers, and civil society, to collectively shape the sustainable finance agenda and catalyse action across the financial system to deliver more sustainable global economies for years to come. This year, the Global Roundtable will be held under the same roof as Building Bridges (9-12 December), a powerful movement that brings 2500+ attendees from 100+ countries from the finance and corporate sectors, governments, civil society, academia, and sustainable development communities to Geneva annually, to shape the global sustainable finance agenda and build a bridge towards a global economic model that meets the needs of a sustainable and just society.
