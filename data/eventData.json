Underpinned by the government's commitment to enhancing digital resilience through initiatives like the Cybersecurity Act and the establishment of the Cyber Security Agency (CSA), the nation continues to adopt forward-looking approaches to combat evolving cyber threats and safeguard its critical infrastructure. Singapore maintains its vigilance and adaptability by continuously investing in cutting-edge technologies and fostering collaborations to ensure its digital landscape remains secure and resilient against future cyber challenges . In addition, this approach equips both businesses and individuals with the necessary tools and knowledge to navigate the digital age safely. Despite this progressive momentum, cyber incidents remain a significant challenge in Singapore. As a leading innovation hub, Singapore is particularly vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, with the Singapore Cybersecurity Agency (CSA) reporting a marked increase in cybercrimes such as phishing, ransomware, and scams in recent years. More importantly, as cyber threats grow more sophisticated, organisations in Singapore must consistently update their security strategies and invest in advanced technologies to stay ahead of potential risks. A key cybersecurity solution for strengthening security postures in Singapore is integrating the Zero Trust framework. This approach is especially crucial given Singapore's status as a global financial hub and its heavy reliance on digital infrastructure for both public and private sector operations. Operating on the principle of \"never trust, always verify,\" Zero Trust ensures that every access request is authenticated, authorised, and continuously validated. However, a significant challenge of Zero Trust is enforcing strict access control without causing excessive friction from frequent verifications. Additionally, existing solutions burden IT teams with the need to analyse extensive log data, requiring large teams and substantial budgets to detect rare attacks. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) becomes invaluable. AI addresses this by introducing behaviour-based user risk scoring, streamlining the process. By analysing real-time data, AI identifies anomalies in user behaviour, providing administrators with tailored security recommendations. Ultimately, the effective integration of Zero Trust and AI helps organisations in Singapore enhance their security postures while minimising operational burdens. This advanced approach ensures robust protection of sensitive data and infrastructure , supporting Singapore's ongoing efforts to foster a secure and innovative digital landscape. AI-Powered Zero Trust Framework Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to extend the effectiveness of the Zero Trust framework in improving security postures. An AI-powered Zero Trust framework leverages AI to dynamically monitor and assess user behaviour, enhancing the detection and mitigation of security threats. This approach ensures continuous verification and adaptive security measures, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorised access and data breaches. Protecting against Next-Gen Threats with Defensive AI The rise of technologies has escalated the risk of AI-driven attacks. To counter this threat, organisations can utilise AI to bolster protection across various security domains , from application security to the Zero Trust framework. This strategy includes developing tailored security measures for each customer, such as API or email protection, and leveraging vast amounts of attack data to train models capable of identifying previously undiscovered application threats. The session will allow delegates to: STREAMLINE Zero Trust processes by integrating AI solutions ENHANCE the effectiveness of Zero Trust through the implementation of AI LEVERAGE AI-powered Zero Trust to reduce the risk of unauthorised access and data breaches EXPLORE the power of Defensive AI in safeguarding organisations from next-gen cyberattacks IMPLEMENT a comprehensive strategy for protecting sensitive data and establishing strong control over infrastructures ADDRESS challenges in navigating Zero Trust and AI for security Who should attend: Chief Information Security Officers Chief Information Officers Chief Technology Officers Chief Data Officers Directors and Heads of Risk and Compliance Directors and Heads of IT Security Directors and Heads of Security Operations Directors and Heads of Data Directors and Heads of Network Operations and Engineering Directors and Heads of IT Infrastructure Directors and Heads of Cloud Architecture Heads of Network Architecture Heads of Security Architecture Heads of Cloud Operations Heads of Information Technology Heads of IT Security",

        "summary": "Revolutionising Government Operations in the Age of AI AI is integral to Singapore's digital transformation, enhancing public service delivery through advanced data analytics and automation. Modern technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can revolutionise governance, not only transforming the capabilities of AI systems but also setting the stage for more advanced applications. However, a survey by Pure Storage revealed that 83% of organisations require substantial IT infrastructure upgrades to leverage AI fully, indicating that many are not yet AI-ready and need significant reconfiguration. In the public sector, agencies are grappling with outdated legacy systems that lack automation, while the demand for processing power and storage continues to rise. Moreover, the government faces significant challenges in information security, privacy, and data resiliency. Generative AI: The Next Frontier GenAI extends far beyond merely generating new content like text, images, audio, and video, encompassing advanced capabilities in data synthesis, pattern recognition, and creative problem-solving. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) are some of the most prominent examples of GenAI. By integrating GenAI into government, Singapore can enhance its competitive edge in smart governance, predictive analytics for policy formulation, and personalised citizen services. Driving Innovation with RAG Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a significant innovation that bridges the gap between generative skills and external knowledge, resulting in more robust and context-aware language understanding and generation systems. A key technique of RAG is in natural language processing, it improves contextual awareness, ensures fluent content, eliminates bias, and manages vast knowledge libraries, making it essential for long-term content development. In Singapore's public sector, where efficiency and precision are critical, RAG allows agencies to streamline operations and provide more responsive services to the public. RAG improves decision-making by enabling rapid and precise data processing, resulting in better insights from massive datasets. Building Robust Data and AI Infrastructure The backbone of effective AI implementation is a robust data and AI infrastructure. According to Pure Storage, high investment costs and a shortage of in-house skills are cited by 73% of organisations as the primary barriers to deploying AI. Another significant challenge, faced by 43%, is the delay in acquiring necessary hardware, especially GPUs. Key components of infrastructure include high-speed connectivity, secure cloud services, and advanced data analytics capabilities. By ensuring that data is accessible and reliable, Singapores public sector can develop platforms that support large-scale data collection, storage, and processing and fully exploit the potential of RAG and GenAI.

        "summary": "Empowering Public Services with Trusted Digital Foundations In today's digital era, cybersecurity is vital for government operations, particularly in Singapore's public sector, which sets a benchmark for the region. As citizen services increasingly rely on digital technologies to enhance citizen engagement, efficiency, and transparency, robust cybersecurity measures are now indispensable. The Cyber Security Agency's (CSA) Annual Report for 2023 revealed that Singapore experienced over 70,200 compromised systems, marking a 14% decrease from the 81,500 compromised systems reported in 2022. This decline reflects the increasing effectiveness of Singapore's cybersecurity policies and a growing awareness among public sector organisations. However, while this reduction is a positive development, it underscores the need for continued efforts to safeguard digital infrastructures. One of the CSA's key initiatives, the Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021, aims to strengthen defences by enhancing capabilities, building alliances, and securing critical information infrastructure. While the CSA has advanced cybersecurity through national frameworks and threat detection platforms, challenges remain in maintaining resilience against evolving threats. A key challenge is the growing sophistication of cyber-attacks, with criminals using AI, machine learning, and advanced tools to infiltrate systems more effectively. Traditional measures like firewalls and antivirus are no longer enough; Singapore's public sector must adopt dynamic, integrated solutions that can detect and respond to breaches in real-time. Another challenge is the fragmented digital infrastructure within the public sector, where different agencies operate on disparate systems, creating vulnerabilities in cybersecurity defences. Without a unified approach to cyber assurance, ensuring comprehensive protection across all digital touchpoints is difficult. Cybercriminals exploit these gaps, targeting weak links to infiltrate larger networks and potentially disrupt public services. To address this issue, which proactive and integrated cybersecurity solutions should Singapore's public sector prioritise to effectively battle modern cyber threats? Unified Cybersecurity Framework A single cybersecurity framework is critical to improving Singapore's public sector security posture. Standardising cybersecurity policy ensures that processes are consistent across all government agencies. This central governance architecture improves effort alignment, fosters collaboration, and reduces vulnerabilities due to separate systems. Secured Networking Secured networking is essential for protecting data integrity, confidentiality, and availability, especially in the face of evolving cyber threats. Key components include next-generation firewalls like FortiGate NGFW, data encryption solutions, and access control tools like passwords and biometrics, which ensure thatonly authorised users can access sensitive information. Additionally, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) monitor traffic for suspicious activity, helping to prevent attacks in real-time. Network segmentation creates isolated network segments, minimising the spread of threats and enforcing stricter access controls to sensitive areas. These measures collectively enhance an organisation's network security. Migration to Cloud Migration to the cloud requires strong security and management, and there are key solutions available to facilitate this transition. Centralised management enables organisations to efficiently oversee security policies across both public and private clouds, ensuring consistent enforcement.Robust VPN capabilities provide secure site-to-site connectivity, safeguarding data during transfers between cloud environments. These solutions are highly scalable, automatically adjusting security as cloud usage grows, ensuring seamless protection. Additionally, support for compliance with stringent regulatory requirements includes encryption, access control, and audit logging to meet data sovereignty and protection laws. Integration of AI and Automation The use of AI and automation in cybersecurity provides a potent approach to battle the growing sophistication of cyber-attacks. AI systems can analyse large volumes of data to uncover trends and abnormalities, allowing for proactive threat identification and response. Organisations can improve their ability to respond to attacks in real-time by automating routine security processes such as monitoring, incident response, and vulnerability management while decreasing the workload on security staff. This collaboration not only improves the overall security posture but also allows organisations to respond more quickly to developing cyber dangers, ensuring strong protection against prospective breaches and assaults. OpenGov Asia extends a personal invitation to an exclusive OpenGov Breakfast Insight focusing on the critical importance of cybersecurity in Singapore's public sector. As digital technologies increasingly support public services to enhance citizen involvement, efficiency, and transparency, addressing the growing sophistication of cyber threats has become essential. This session will allow delegates to: EXPLOR E the current cybersecurity landscape within Singapore's public sector, gaining insights into the latest trends and emerging threats. IDENTIFY the key challenges and vulnerabilities facing government agencies,including the growing sophistication of cyber-attacks and the issues arising from fragmented digital infrastructures.

        "summary": "Addressing Finance Transformation Requirements for Singapore Organisations Financial leaders increasingly face the challenge of leading their organisations through a landscape of unexpected obstacles in today's constantly changing economic environment. The Chief Financial Officer's (CFO) function has grown far beyond traditional financial management to include a strategic mission to promote innovation, improve operational efficiency, and assure long-term sustainability. The future of finance highlights the vital need for the transformation of basic financial activities. As Singapore's position as a global financial hub grows stronger, the challenges for its public sector and businesses have never been higher. Inadequate financial management methods are widely seen as significant hurdles to operational and strategic efficiency in many industries, forcing a transition to more flexible, data-driven approaches. Singaporean organisations face significant hurdles due to outdated systems and procedures that are unable to satisfy current business requirements. These difficulties make it difficult to manage high transaction volumes and adjust to complex trading patterns, as they lead to delays in trading and clearing procedures. These inefficiencies highlight the critical necessity for a thorough revision of all financial management procedures. Outdated financial management systems in Singapore's public sector and corporations affect the entire landscape rather than simply individual organisations. These outdated systems result in fragmented financial data, making it difficult to plan strategically or make informed judgements. Errors, delays, and increased risks become the norm when effective integration and automation are not implemented. As regulatory expectations increase, these organisations must modernise their financial systems and adopt more agile, data-driven processes. Overcoming the critical challenges of outdated financial management systems among Singapores public sector and enterprises requires the urgent adoption of cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) solutions . How Can Cloud-based ERP and EPM Solutions Turn Around Poor Financial Performance? Planning and Forecasting: By automating manual procedures and integrating data from throughout the organisation, cloud-based EPM solutions improve planning and forecasting. With real-time insights and standardised inputs, firms may increase forecasting accuracy by switching from intricate spreadsheets to a single platform. This change lowers errors, boosts consistency, and helps teams make data-driven decisions more quickly, leading to more accurate financial projections. Empowering Financial Planning: These technologies transform financial planning by combining historical data, budgets, and projections into unified models. This integration enables exact trend analysis and risk assessment while minimising errors and inefficiencies through automated data aggregation. Real-time data keeps financial insights current, allowing for faster and more strategic decision-making. Furthermore, automating difficult calculations and consolidations improves data processing efficiency, allowing finance teams to focus on strategic projects and increasing agility in a changing business environment. Maximising Efficiency and Effectiveness with Automation : Automating financial procedures dramatically improves efficiency and effectiveness. Employees can devote more time to strategic activities that drive corporate success by removing regular duties like data collection and consolidation.

        "summary": "What You'll Do In Maharashtrian tradition, families gather for lunch on the 13th day after a loved ones passing. This meal serves as a tribute and a reminder that life, like laddoo, a sweet dish always served on such occasions, is a beautiful balance between sweet and sour. Vishakha, honouring her father-in-law who passed away earlier this year, will be preparing a menu reflecting his tradition. Guests can expect comforting dishes like rice kheer, tangy kokum, and her father-in-laws favourite fried vadai a heartfelt nod to his memory. About Whats For My Dinner In moments of remembrance, food becomes a heartfelt tribute to our departed loved ones. This year, join us as we witness the preparation of these special meals and learn about the connection between food and the departed from communities from different cultures, nationalities and background. Multiculturalism is important in Singapore as it serves as the bedrock of the nation's societal fabric. It fosters mutual respect and harmony among diverse ethnic communities with different cultural practices, languages and religions. This shared understanding bridges social divides, cultivating an environment where every individual feels valued and included. It shapes Singapore's unique identity on the global stage, fortifying its reputation as a cosmopolitan hub. Food serves as a conduit for understanding and appreciating our neighbours culture and traditions. From Singaporean food to ASEAN cuisine to far beyond, there are dishes sure to suit everyones tastebuds. Through interacting with members from different communities, Whats For My Dinner aims to inculcate a greater awareness of the diverse communities residing in Singapore. It spotlights Singapore, through many of its culinary adaptions, as a melting pot of cultures and encourages deeper appreciation of our multicultural identity. Be inspired by the flavours and friendships and let us makan (dine)! About The Host Vishakha was born in Baroda, Gujarat but raised in Nagpur, Maharashtra. She studied Hotel Management and worked in Mumbai and Pune. Back in India, she was a culinary teacher and chef. When she met her partner, a captain of a merchant navy, she travelled the world. In 2019, they moved to Singapore. However, no matter where she goes, food still reminds Vishakha of her hometown.

Or are you dying to talk about your latest read with fellow book folk? Come on down to the Anti-Book Club! At the Anti-Book Club, there is no designated book of the month. Instead, everyone is invited to bring a book they recently finished - regardless of whether they liked, loved, or loathed it - and tell the rest of us what this book does (or doesnt do) for you. We are open to all kinds of books - audio, electronic, old school. In fact, it doesnt even have to be a book, as long as it is book-adjacent. And you dont have to bring the physical thing, just be willing to share something about it. The event will be facilitated by John Evans, long-time friend of SPACE4 and the cooperative movement, and Nida Sajid, resident librarian at creative collective Studio61, who will guide us through an evening of fun discussions. We will kick-off with an introduction by John and Nida, delving into their motivations for setting up the Anti-Book Club and what they hope to realise through it. We will then split up into smaller groups to chat about the books people have brought with them. Following this, we will reconvene as a room to share our insights and identify common themes across our audience-chosen book nook. There will be a selection of drinks and snacks available on the night as well as the option to purchase a home-cooked dinner, served up by Studio61s culinary team. The organisers John Evans is a software developer and imagineer residing in cyberspace. He is the project lead of spacetu.be, a group communication tool. Nida Sajid is a bibliophile living in London.

But where do you start? How do you contract for maximum growth and innovation? **If you want the low down on everything involved with protecting your valuable IP in all of the contracts you might need to protect it in- this is the session for you ** Agenda: In this highly practical 60-minute session, we will work through the following: Why is protecting your IP so important? Confidentiality is a key issue, should you disclose confidential information and if you do, how do you ensure that your NDAs actually protect it? Your start-up is only growing from here on out. There are going to be other people, employees and contractors and consultants, helping in the development of the business and perhaps the development of the IP. How can you be sure that no one else ends up with a claim to your IP? What are the key issues and pitfalls in your out-sourcing agreements and consultancy agreements to make sure you retain ownership and control of your IP and new IP that is developed? If youre a university spin-out, then youre unlikely to have ownership of all the IP you need to develop and grow your company. What kind of licence agreement should you expect from the university? What should you be looking for in the grant funding agreements that created the IP in the first place? Collaborations are great, but how do you negotiate the key rights you need when new IP is created? Investor Due Diligence: How can you be sure that youve got the IP rights you need to give investors confidence in your start-up? How to avoid the chaos. If you use any Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in your company, what are the legal issues and pitfalls to be aware of? Who is this for? This session is for anyone wanting to understand the legal arrangements around intellectual property in contracts and to help their company grow.

Stephen Jones, Fresh Egg Stephen started his career as a bookseller in a busy branch of Waterstones, supervising the order section and advising on a branch-wide strategy for customer ordering. He followed books into a library career, first at a legal library in the City and then the Research Library at the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB). During this period, he helped convert the library catalogue into an online, user-accessible, digital format and integrate with the collection held by the National Library for the Blind, resulting in the largest accessible catalogue of research material on blindness in Europe. Moving into publishing, Stephen then became web marketing manager at Elsevier Health Sciences, managing the B2C and B2B websites for EMEA and the email marketing activity conducted from the UK and Amsterdam. He co-managed the revision and build of the main customer-facing website, helped spearhead the development of health sciences E-books, and gained a reputation for rather irreverent presentations at sales meetings and company digital summits. Looking to expand his digital experience, he then moved into affiliate marketing and subsequently wholesale email marketing, managing a monthly inventory of around 40 million addresses, before joining Fresh Eggs SEO department in 2010. Promoted to SEO Director in 2024, he has worked across various clients in the financial, charity, retail, employment and education sectors, including those with a multinational site presence.

With increasingly restricted budgets and services being strained to support more people, these sectors are forced to do more with fewer resources. This challenge is combined with high debt interest rates, mandatory improvement of home standards, strict energy efficiency objectives, and green targets. To alleviate pressure, a drive for operational efficiency and improved productivity is central to success and technology offers the opportunity to deliver services more cost-effectively, but with so many touch points, are there more efficient ways to connect to our communities? One way of doing this is the single front door. It provides a single point of contact between citizens and services. It triages individuals to ensure they receive the right service(s) at their point of need whether adult social care; tech-enabled care; debt advice, or digital inclusion. In this roundtable we will be joined by speakers including Matt Adam, Founder of We Are Group , a champion of connecting communities to ask how we can create more integrated services and discuss whether the single front door approach improves outcomes.

        "summary": "This month we'll be hearing from Claire Douglas , Head of Marketing at RM Technology, and PR & Comms Consultant Emma Duke , about how to use your people and your content to establish authority in your industry. Claire's based in Wallingford and loves being outdoors, either on the sidelines of a pitch cheering on her football-mad son or on long walks trying to wear out her dog. Emma's based in Cowley, enjoys a wild swim (no matter the weather), and when she was nine years old she once played badminton with Jason Donovan live on Radio 1. Thought leadership is a massively overused phrase in marketing, and often people don't even really know what they mean by it, or what they want to get out of it. But when it's done right it's not just some wishy-washy bit of jargon - it's a serious tool for growing your brand and its bottom line. So we'll kick off by looking at exactly what a thought-leadership campaign is and why it can be valuable, learning how to set clear goals and get buy-in (and investment) from across the organisation. Then we'll focus on how your company can actually be a thought leader in your space - what good campaigns might look like, who to involve, and how to get (and keep) people's attention. And finally we'll think about how you can track and demonstrate ROI, learn from the work for next time, and put the results to good use for the wider business. Between them Claire and Emma have run a ton of thought-leadership campaigns - for all kinds of brands from one-man-bands to places like OUP and Hodder Education - so the talk will be stuffed full of real-life examples and practical advice. ----------------------------------- How our gatherings usually go 6pm: Doors open for (free) drinks, marketing chit-chat, and - let's face it - probably at least some small talk about the weather 6.15-7.15pm: A brilliant marketing talk from a knowledgeable and interesting human, plus some Q&A and informal group discussion 7.15-7.30pm: Its GUS time (thats Genuinely Useful Shit) 7.30-8pm: More (still free) drinks and fun chat, hopefully about more interesting stuff than the weather by this point Here youll find everyone from marketing managers and comms execs to freelancers, solo business owners, and students exploring the industry.

Anna lives in Enstone with her partner, young daughter, and two cheeky cats who love to bring her daily gifts (read: dead mice and birds) and in her spare time she enjoys getting creative with a bit of bag-making or furniture painting. Most companies think more about how their marketing team can help with an event (e.g. promotion) rather than how an event can help their marketing team. But given that events can grow awareness, increase loyalty, and lead to sales, they're actually a brilliant marketing tool. So in this session we'll be learning how to effectively bring them into your marketing mix - and make the most of them. We'll start by looking at the different kinds of events businesses could think about hosting - whether online or IRL - and the pros/cons of various options. And we'll explore how we can look at events through a marketing lens, considering key questions and activities it's good to think about before, during, and after. Then we'll focus on how we can define and measure success, as well as learn from our efforts so we can do even better next time around. And all accompanied by plenty of real-life examples of great (and not-so-great) events and how they've contributed meaningfully to brand growth. ----------------------------------- How our gatherings usually go 6pm: Doors open for (free) drinks, marketing chit-chat, and - let's face it - probably at least some small talk about the weather 6.15-7.15pm: A brilliant marketing talk from a knowledgeable and interesting human, plus some Q&A and informal group discussion 7.15-7.30pm: Its GUS time (thats Genuinely Useful Shit) 7.30-8pm: More (still free) drinks and fun chat, hopefully about more interesting stuff than the weather by this point Here youll find everyone from marketing managers and comms execs to freelancers, solo business owners, and students exploring the industry.

The joint Chamber of Commerce and Trowbridge Police event will be an opportunity for businesses to exchange information with the police and fellow businesses and to discuss issues affecting local retailers with a view to reducing retail crime. Shopwatch schemes play a crucial role in enhancing the safety and security of retail environments. These schemes bring together local businesses, law enforcement and community safety teams to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour in shopping areas. Effective communication is at the heart of Shopwatch schemes, enabling quick responses to incidents and the sharing of vital information. Digital two-way radios such as Storenet, which is in operation in Trowbridge stores, have become an indispensable tool for these initiatives, offering numerous benefits that enhance the effectiveness of Shopwatch schemes. Shopwatch is a community based initiative where businesses in a specific area collaborate to prevent crime. The scheme often involves regular meetings between local shop owners, security personnel, and the police to discuss issues, share information and coordinate responses to criminal activity. Participants often use two-way radios to communicate in real-time, enabling them to respond quickly to incidents and deter potential offenders. Sergeant Charly Chilton of the Trowbridge Community Policing team said: \"This meeting will give retailers an opportunity to discuss the issues they are currently experiencing and for the local Neighbourhood Policing team to talk about the work they are currently doing to tackle shoplifting and other associated offences\". Chair of Trowbridge Chamber, Kez Garner, said: \"We are pleased to organise this meeting with Trowbridge Police and local businesses to address the issue of retail crime. All businesses are encouraged to report any ASB, shoplifting and other offences and to sign up to our town centre Storenet radio system. Installing CCTV is also recommended to add to the increasing CCTV coverage of the town centre.\" Please book your FREE TICKET ASAP . Coffee will be available from 1345.",

        "summary": "Are you a Founder or CEO or BD pitching for investment or sales? Are you looking to learn from, and share experiences, with your peers and experienced industry professionals? Would you like to participate in an informative, engaging and fun thought-leadership discussion about your pitch under Chatham House Rules? Are you available on the afternoon of 23 Oct and can you get to the Mills Fabrica, 36-40 York Way, Kings Cross, London N19AB, it is next to Kings Cross Station? If your answer is yes to these questions, then this #AgileLeaders Investor and Sales Pitch Workshop is for you. The session is run by Prof Tony Sedgwick who has had an esteemed career in Big Pharma where he use to be Global Head of Clinical Research for 10+ years at Roche AG. Tony has also been CEO of 4 biotechs and Chairman of 10 biotechs plus he started a VC fund for Pierre Fabre, so he knows a thing or two. Tony has also recently been inspired by an acting and comedy course where he can see parallels with pitching for investment, instead they pitch for a particular play, film, TV Show or other opportunity. To be discussed: Pitching with Confidence: The importance of performance: This is the first of a series of #AgileLeaders events where we focus on helping entrepreneurs, founders, and CEOs be investor-ready and BD to be sales ready. We will be thinking more like professionals coming into the performance space. We will be thinking of a space like a theatre space or an audition in which we want to impress the investors from the first time they see us. This session will be perfect for those that think mainly of the content and not primarily of the performance they are giving. Tony, and Graham, will be using all their experience as a scientist, CEO, Chairman, VC, Acting, BD and Comedy to help you deliver your best performance and gain the investor or client's attention so that you are memorable and get that investment you need to take your business to the next level. In today's world, it is all about differentiation and performance, and not only what's in the pitch deck, although that is also important. 80% of a sale or investor pitch is about Performance and Personality, only 20% is about the content of your pitch. The science or idea will not sell itself. Instead, you need to sell yourself. This session suits individuals or teams looking to raise money for health innovation or differentiate themselves in a highly diversified life science sector. How do you benefit from attending? As a \"Leader\" in a life sciences innovation company you will benefit from this \"Agile\" workshop by sharing common challenges and building deeper connections and trust with your peers. In turn, the aim is to build your confidence when working in areas typically outside your comfort zone, by learning and having discussions with this / your \"Agile\" peer network. You can speak to people in a similar position about issues you may not have the opportunity to talk about elsewhere. You can discuss your challenges by learning from other people's experiences to help you find a solution or spark an idea. Why let leaders of emerging companies reinvent the wheel to be successful when we can learn from the experiences of others who have faced similar challenges before? Chatham House Rules apply - \"what goes on in the workshop, stays in the workshop - so to speak!\" Our mission is to help you build your innovation-enabled healthcare business so it is \"fit for purpose,\" truly innovative and attractive to the global markets. Helping you build solid trustworthy networks with your peer group, and help spread your creative R&D business network nationally and internationally. Our motivation and focus are on helping you build long-term trustworthy business relationships and support you on your journey through our supportive business community. This workshop is facilitated by Prof Tony Sedgwick, the self-professed www.ThoughtDisruptor.com. Tony has an esteemed career in academia and in business, he is a trained pathologist. His accolades include once being the Global Head of Clinical Trials at Roche AG, being a VC and being one of the UK's first Biotech CEOs. Tony has now been CEO of four life science companies, Chairman of over 10 Companies, and many positions within the academic community. He is also an active psychologist helping him develop his \"Agile\" community group development passion and is a Jiu-Jitsu Grand Master VI. Last year Tony published the book \"The Mighty Advisor\" which became a number 1 best seller in the Amazon STEM Business Management category. He most recently has been on a full-time acting course, and his next goal is to get on Coronation Street or Eastenders! We will start this Agile Leaders Workshop on Wednesday, 23 October, with a 1.30 pm arrival (with a prompt 2.00 pm start). This is at the Mills Fabrica Office Space in the Kings Cross where it offers companies big and small lab space in the heart of the now named Knowledge Quarter. This is the prime real estate along the side of Kings Cross Station on York Way near all the exciting new life science and tech innovation organisations like MSD's new research facility, Google's new European Headquarters, the Crick Institute, University College Hospital, the Wellcome Trust HQ and so much more. We are limiting this event to a maximum of 25 Life Science Innovation Leaders only. Our promise to you is our #AgileLeaders Forum will be like no other life sciences workshop and business network you have experienced. You will be walking out of the session inspired, educated and more connected.

        "summary": "Hello and thank you for your interest in joining a SPIRAL.IN women's circle! I believe that having a space where we can be unapologetically ourselves is a necessity, especially in a world where we are often expected to play a certain role, that of the mother, the colleague, the partner, the friend... Joining a SPIRAL.IN circle is an opportunity for women to hush the noise of day-to-day life, let the masks slip off and spiral inwards to find the woman underneath it all. Authenticity is a big thing at SPIRAL.IN so know that you belong in circle exactly as you are ! What even is a women's circle? You might be a pro at sitting in circle but in case you're new to it: a women's circle is a group of women who come together to support each other by sharing their authentic truth and by being witnessed and accepted for who they really are. You might choose to share a lot, only a little bit or nothing at all. Circle is a collaborative process, I facilitate but by being authentic and real, each group of women cocreates their own unique experience. A women's circle will usually have a couple of simple guidelines, which I will go through with you at the start of our circle. The most important ones are that this space is confidential and that SPIRAL.IN circles are not therapy. I am a trained circle faciliator (through Sister Stories) but not a therapist. Practicalities To keep my circles small and relaxed, the maximum number of participants is 10. In order to offer as many women as possible the support of a SPIRAL.IN circle, you can choose between a reduced cost ticket and a standard ticket, with a limited number of tickets each. You also have the option to make a donation, which gives me the opportunity to offer a ticket to women who wouldn't be able to afford the full cost of joining. No questions asked, I trust you know what ticket option is most affordable in your current personal situation. There is absolutely nothing to prepare, just wear something comfortable and show up as you are on the day. Please arrive 10 to 15 minutes early so we can start on time (and have a tea first!) and avoid being late as once I have opened our cirlce, I won't be able to admit late-comers. Circles are held at our family home so for evening circles, please be aware that some bath and bedtime noises may be heard. If you are not comfortable with this, please book a weekend circle instead. Cirlce is a tender space so anyone who is intoxicated won't be admitted. This is a circle for women over 18 only. This also means that if you feel a strong connection with your womb space as a non-binary person or trans-woman, you are most welcome here. Unfortunately my current location is not wheelchair accessible. If you are feeling unwell or have symptoms of covid-19, please do not attend our circle so we can keep everyone safe. You'll receive an email from me about one week before our circle with all the information, iincluding full location (please check your spam) but if you would have any questions or worries before then, please don't hesitate to get in touch at hello@spiral-in.co.uk SPIRAL.IN is the place for you if you would like to join a women's circle where you can reconnect not only to yourself but to other like-minded women who carry and support you. I cant wait to hold that space for you! Much love, Charlotte",

There will be three women-only sessions before the end of the year (26th October, 16th November and 7th December), so save the dates! *** Are you seeking community but struggling to find your people? Looking to cultivate more authentic connections and have deeper conversations? Join us in an exploration of the art of community building and authentic connection. At Held, we believe the key to fulfilling our potential lies in our ability to create collaborative communities that nourish and inspire us. This is your space if any of these resonate with you: You're craving for community and struggling to find your people in an overly individualistic society. You're tired of superficial connections and are looking for a way to have deeper conversations about what really matters to you. You agree that being human can be a very weird/intense/extremely confusing experience sometimes, and nobody should go through it without support. You sometimes feel stuck and disconnected from yourself, others and life at large. You are tired of reading/listening to self-development content on your own without a community to share your insights with. You've benefited from therapy and are taking care of your mental health but feel you lack a supportive community to share your growth and insights with. You're k een to connect with other like-minded women. You're passionate about building collaborative supportive communities but don't know where to start. If this sounds like you, we can't wait to meet you! What to expect: This is a very interactive, playful, and reflective workshop where we will: Learn how to (really) listen to ourselves and make space in our minds to actively listen to the experience of others. We will do this through mindfulness, journaling, and reflection (bring your favourite notebook/journal and pen!). Practice peer-coaching and peer-counselling skills to create a safe container for everyone to discuss their insights with others. Play with connecting questions to support our reflections and conversations. These are questions specifically chosen to help us understand and share what truly matters to us and others. Have fun! The sessions will be facilitated by me (hi!). I am Fran Vicario, a mindfulness mentor, mental health coach and founder of Held in Community. If you have any questions or want to know more about this project please don't hesitate to get in touch with me on fran@heldincommunity.com. I'd love to hear from you! By booking onto this session you are confirming that you: are over 18 years of age and identify as a woman. understand that these sessions are designed to be a supportive environment, but they cannot replace therapy or medical care. accept to take full responsibility for your own wellbeing and mental health during the sessions. *** This community `building workshop is brought to you by Held in Community. At Held , we facilitate spaces to nurture deep human connection based on authenticity, collaboration, and deep respect for the complexity of everyones life experience. Lets face it being human is a pretty intense experience. The spectrum of our feelings and emotions is endless and yet, our current society does not seem to provide us with many tools or spaces to process the intensity of our life experience in a balanced and healthy way. Held aims to tackle our generalised sense of disconnection from each other and the world we live in, by responding to the needs of those who long for real connection and caring communities. We're extremely excited to share more events with you as we grow! Make sure to join our mailing list and follow us on social media if Held sounds like the space for you. We'll keep you updated with future events as soon as they come out! Instagram: @heldincommunity Facebook: Held in Community Much love, Fran x",

Every job is a climate job, so come along and learn about how you can take action, as well as what is going on locally. We welcome everyone, regardless of their experience or background. People Planet Pint is a space where everyone can feel comfortable learning about sustainability and sharing their ideas. Afterall, creating a sustainable future requires connected communities.

Your Volunteer Hosts Raechel Kelly worked in sustainable finance for 12 years, on ESG analysis and fossil fuel divestment. In 2020 she set up The Liminality , her small solo project working on climate communications and facilitation. In the same year she approached local charity Vision 21 to set up Planet Cheltenham , the town's first community climate solutions hub with the aim of empowering residents around joyful climate action. She now runs several projects including a Youth Climate Group, Little Planet Cheltenham baby group, and took part in the pilot Doughnut Economics Learning Journey as a host to some amazing local renegade economists. She is a NED at Good With Money, an RSA fellow, and you will always find her in the kitchen at parties (asking where the recycling bin is).

Join us and over 400 emerging challenger brands, industry experts, retailers, distributors, investors and press for an EPIC celebration this December at Crate in Hackney Wick, East London. Spaces are limited - last year sold out. Don't miss out on the party of the year and grab your ticket today. What can you expect? Celebrate with 4 00+ challenger food & drink brands Free flowing craft beers, softs and pizza. Secret Santa: bring your products (or a gift of any kind, up to 10) to take part in this classic Christmas activity - give a gift and receive one back from under the Christmas tree. Wrapping paper will be available. Chilled, pre-launch or just a bit complicated? No worries - bring a small wrapped gift of any kind to join in. The Producers' Table: a Bread & Jam favourite! Bring along your products, check out what everyone else is producing and get industry feedback. Why are we hosting a Christmas Party? We hosted our first Christmas Party in 2022, as a way to bring our community together at the end of a tough year for many food and drink businesses. We thought we'd be pretty chuffed if a couple dozen people came to share a drink or two with us... So we were pretty blown away when hundreds of people turned up and filled the pub! We realised that the food and drink community needed to kick back, celebrate and raise a drink just as much as we did. So, we're back for a second year, in a much bigger venue, so everyone can join in. Whether you're a food and drink founder, part of a food brand team, an industry expert, a pre-launch startup, a distributor, a manufacturer, a product developer, a branding guy... Anyone involved in the food and drink world is welcome and we can't wait to see you there.",

This informal networking event is kindly supported by Barings, in their Old Bailey venue, with pastries, teas and coffees available for all attendees. Start your working week by hearing inspiring stories from people who have experienced homelessness as well as easy to-do things that will make a life-changing difference this winter, including the charity's Big Give week (3 to 10 December) where all donations are doubled thanks to the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust. Whether it's wearing a Christmas jumper, joining us on social media or buying original artwork to support the homeless charity - and gain an investment - your support will offer a brighter future to the 1,300+ people Oasis Community Housing supports across the UK every year. At the event, chat to existing supporters like Barings Director Sara Stewart and Artist Crispin, creator of 'Savage Garden - Elon Musk' $2m painting on display. See his special 'Whispers of Hope' & 'Rewind NA' pieces that will be auctioned to raise funds for the Giving a Home Appeal. Homelessness seems to loom larger than all of us, but you can have a real part in turning the tide, with this year's Appeal set to make the most difference possible. In years to come you'll be able to say, 'I was one of the original 50 in 2024 at the very first London Launch of the Giving a Home Appeal'. Free event - just 50 places available, booking essential.",

        "summary": "Hello, We are Mia, Katy, Sarah and Jake, and we are Shamanic Collective. We have experienced first-hand the deep healing and powerful transformation that shamanic work can facilitate when we are open to receiving guidance and knowledge from the liminal, otherworldly realms and the depths of our own being. Having studied with various teachers and shamans from around the world, we are passionate about sharing these modalities with those who seek holistic and alternative ways of healing. If youre interested in exploring shamanic healing, please join us for an afternoon of nourishing and joyful healing in community at the Bonnington Community Centre in Southwest London. Our community healings offer an opportunity to receive healing on emotional, physical and spiritual levels, re-establishing harmony, sovereignty and power. If you wish, you may join the 'healing chorus' to support the process with instruments and intention. Each participant receives a one-to-one shamanic healing. No previous experience required, just an open mind and heart. We are part of a larger network of shamanic practitioners and we occasionally invite other practitioners to help us faciliate our community events. Please note, the room is on the third floor of the building and unfortunately there is no wheelchair access. If you have any questions or need futher information, please email collectiveshamanic@gmail.com. We look forward to meeting you. Shamanic Collective What our clients say: \"Thank you all for an amazing afternoon! I attended not fully knowing what to expect as I have not been to many events like this before. The environment was very calm and welcoming, with a beautiful altar set up for us to place offerings on. The healing session was a calming yet empowering experience for me. I felt like I went into a deep state and could have quite happily stayed for hours! It was so lovely to sit afterwards and talk through the experience with Sarah one-to-one, and to gain some insights into myself. After the healing I felt very serene and uplifted, and at the same time had a feeling of childlike excitement that I haven't felt for some time. I would love to attend more events in the future and highly recommend to anyone who is seeking healing and guidance in a safe, comfortable space with experienced practitioners! Thank you all so much.\" - Martha",

        "summary": "The African entrepreneurial ecosystem is growing and flourishing internationally, and its been made possible through collaboration and partnerships between founders, investors, and entrepreneur support organizations. With the African entrepreneurial landscape developing both on the continent, in the U.K and in the wider international market, there is an incredible opportunity to kick-start a networking event that brings these parties together. This networking event is designed for African founders, investors, techpreneurs, innovators, culture-shifters, distruptors, technology experts, entrepreneur support organizations who work and focus on the African continent and the international market and are based in the U.K. Through live interactive sessions, attendees will get to connect with like-minded individuals, share their knowledge and insights as well as get access to resources to help them succeed. The event will feature speakers from different industries and sectors such as finance, healthcare, technology, travel, etc. who will provide valuable insight into their respective fields while fostering a sense of creativity amongst attendees. Additionally, representatives from UK government agencies will be invited to provide advice on how best to run a UK business and secure financing for international projects. In addition to connecting people already involved in the African entrepreneurial space this event is intended to serve as a gateway for new Africans entrepreneurs looking to join this vibrant community by offering mentorship opportunities with more experienced members of the network. As part of our efforts to foster successful relationships between partners in this ecosystem we plan on hosting similar events every quarter throughout 2023 with each event focusing on different topics related to entrepreneurship in Africa and the U.K. based on the book Investment Worthy Startup by Tomi Davies (TD) . We believe that such actions can bridge the gap between aspiring entrepreneurs in Africa and those living in the UK Diaspora by creating deeper connections among peers which can lead towards greater collaboration opportunities down the line. AGENDA 18:00- 19:00 II Doors open & socialize 19:00 - 20:30 II Pitch and Q&A with speaker 20:30 - Close II Networking Series Investor Panel: Harry Tomi Davies (TD) is Collaborator-in-Chief (CiC)' at TVC Labs , an entrepreneurship support organisation working with technology-enabled innovation in Lagos, Nigeria which he founded. TD is the founding President of the African Business Angel Network ( ABAN ) and board member of the Global Business Angel Network (GBAN). As an active stakeholder in the African startup ecosystem he values intellect, innovation, independence, collaboration and integrity in all our relationships TD believes that humans are using technology to build a better life for humankind and innovative African startup founders are using technology to build a better Africa. He also firmly believes that supporting innovative startups creates economic value and social impact and that innovation hubs and business angels are a critical local resource to founder and startup growth. He asserts that locally led international support accelerates the development of the African startup ecosystems. After graduating from the University of Miami in 1982, TD led innovative technology-enabled transformation initiatives for influential global brands such as Elf Aquitaine , Marks & Spencer , Ernst & Young and Sapient across Europe, the United States and Southeast Asia. In 2000, his focus shifted to Africa where he worked on various technology-led innovation initiatives in Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana and Kenya using his goal-oriented approach to project delivery which inspired his 2014 book The African Project Manager . In December 2021, TD was named as one of the 100 Most Influential Africans of 2021 by New African Magazine. TD is Chairman of Powerstove (Renewables) and Non-Executive Director at MBO Capital (Private Equity) and sits on the boards of Big Cabal Media (Media & Entertainment) and Laptops4Learning (L4L) Nigeria (Edutech NGO). He also Chairs the Innovation Committee of the Lagos State Science, Research and Innovation Council (LASRIC). As an angel investor with insights gained from a growing portfolio of tech-enabled startup ventures originating from Africa, his personal goal is to Find, Fund & Follow, African founders that are using technology-enabled innovation to create economic value and social impact on the continent that builds Africas future together. These founders are the inspiration and target of his 2023 book Investment Worthy Startup which lays out his POEM Framework as a tool for building tech-enabled startups on the continent and their investors.

We're very grateful to them for hosting us! We're also thankful to our new event sponsor, Othership , a platform to work the Other way with flexible workspaces, weekly events, member benefits & a welcoming community. Please note that by signing up for this event on Eventbrite you agree to share your name and email address with Othership.

Just like the freeCodeCamp platform, attendance to this meetup is always free. The room has a capacity of around 20 people.

What is great about us, there are NO ANNUAL FEES, zero, none and nothing to join, but we are confident that if you visit us once you will be back again and again! The only commitment we ask is for a direct debit to be set up for future attendance, should in the unlikely event you want to leave, one in-person event notice is required. Included as part of this event, is an informal virtual networking once a month, totally FREE for attendees of this event! This is a great way to catch up and re-connect, maybe life and work got in the way after this meeting and you never got round to making that call or sending that email. Don't forget to bring at least 30 business cards or leaflets to pass around the at the event, during the meeting you will be given the chance to tell us about you and your business, where you are based and what you provide in a One Minute Interval (OMI), which can be really powerful. I look forward to meeting you and learning about your business!",

We come together to give ourselves time, space and nourishment to express what needs to be expressed in a brave space. Sitting shoulder to shoulder with other women. Providing a confidential, nurturing space for women to gather together in community to learn from each other, share together and uplift each other. Each month we will enjoy a different well-being practise together covering areas like seated yoga and gentle movement, meditation, Ayurveda, mindfulness, breathwork, reflection, journaling, yoga nidra and more. Gentle, tender ways to rejuvenate our bodies and nervous systems, allowing us all to tap into simple yet potent practises to bring deep calm, confidence and intuition into our work, personal life and play. Well gather around the fire (candlelight) to talk and share, creating a sense of connection and belonging. \"when I booked, I really didn't know what to expect. So glad I came along as I had a really nice evening and along with yourself, met some really lovely women. I will defininetly be at the next one ... the tongue scraping has got me intrigued! It was such an informative evening but done in such a calm and relaxed manner.\" Practicalities What to bring? Yourself, just as you are (and a notebook and pen). Refreshments - there will be a selection of drinks for us to prepare for ourselves. 10% discount! - anyone coming along to Circle is entitled to 10% discount at Harriet's of Hove on the evening of the event - so make sure to allow a little extra time for shopping! Location - Harriet's of Hove is in George Street, Hove. Our meeting will take place in the beautiful first floor event space, where we can access drinks and bathroom facilities. Please note that at this time there is no disabled access to the first floor space. What brings me here? Honestly, its a kind of pull, a kind of knowing that this is the work I need to be doing right now. I am very used to leading large groups of yoga, teaching workshops and intimate one-to-one work with Coaching clients and those interested in yoga, meditation and Ayurveda. However this is very different. I am not the leader of these Circles, I am merely the facilitator and we create the sessions within our growing community together.

        "summary": "Gathering in circle to speak and to listen is an ancient tradition, one that we dont often practice in our modern lives. It is a very simple practice and a very powerful one. It is as much about deep listening as it is voicing what needs to be said. It is a place that is open to imperfection and vulnerability, to have your whole self be welcomed and held. The circle will be held for 1.5 hours. We will start with a short meditation, to set the tone for the space we create together. There will then be a reminder of the guidelines which help us to hold that space respectfully. We start with a short share, responding to a question, running around the circle in turn, to help familiarise ourselves with speaking in the circle. And then the space is open for what needs to be given voice. We will finish with another short share and a closing of the circle. To maintain the integrity of the circle we use guidelines that help us to be gentle with everyones vulnerability: the circle is confidential, nothing that is shared in the circle leaves the circle; we speak from our experience, from our personal story; we dont offer advice, or respond to what others have shared; silence is as welcome as sharing. This space is being offered for women and minority genders. Consessions available at 50% discount for students, NHS, low and no income etc. Please contact me for the discount code. The circle will be held in the cabin at Barracks Lane Community Garden. The cabin and the facilities there are fully accessible for those with mobility needs. Generally we will be seated on the floor, but if this is not possible for you chairs will be available. On street parking is available near the venue. I hope that you will join us.

Our meetings provide members and guests with the opportunity to develop and practice speaking and leadership skills. We meet every 2nd and 4th Wednesday of the month from 7.30 pm until 9.30 pm. What Happens in Our Meetings We devote the first half of the meeting to prepared speeches . Members sign up in advance to write and rehearse a short speech before delivering it to the audience. The second half of the meeting begins with a series of evaluations . Every prepared speaker in the first half receives constructive feedback and advice on improving their speeches from other members. We then have a go at delivering impromptu speeches in a section called Table Topics . Guests will get a taste of public speaking by joining us in Table Topics. This is a fun and popular segment that challenges you to think on your feet and get used to speaking off-the-cuff to an audience. We will invite attendees to take part by talking about a given topic for up to two minutes. Impromptu speaking can be scary for newcomers, but its something youll want to keep coming back to time and time again! Agenda Highlights Warm-up introductions for guests and members Speeches or workshops delivered by our members Feedback on speeches from evaluators Table Topics for guests and members Post-meeting social chat Everyone is Welcome Our meetings have people coming from all walks of life, with a range of backgrounds and levels of experience.

Each attendee is given 3-4 minutes which means you have the time to talk and explain in more detail about you and what you have been up to (we may, at times, need to restrict each person to a maximum of 2 questions after their pitch, this will be based on number of attendees, if there is time at the end we can then return to any questions that were not asked) We will start the meeting at 7.15am breakfast available from 7.30am and the sit down meeting will begin at 7.45am starting with with updates from the club followed by everyone telling us about themselves. We will be wrapped up by 9.30am so people can get on with their day having had a shot of dopamine to spark them into a positive and productive day.

Our unique venue is: Set in a stunning six-story building at Berkeley Square, Hay Hill is unique as it combines the luxury of a private members club with the business focus of a co-working environment, pioneering the concept of the club working, all in the heart of Mayfair. For our event, we have reserved an area of the venue with a cash bar, so that we can mix and mingle and meet old and new friends, new contacts, and, why not, new clients too! Program The format of the evening is 'mix and mingle', meet like-minded business leaders and entrepreneurs and investors in a relaxed environment. Our team is onsite to facilitate meaningful introductions. We connect at a human-to-human level, and prefer building relationships. How many people are attending? We have a maximum capacity of 80 guests for this venue and given the popularity of our events and the nature of the venue that hosts us, this one is predicted to be sold out in advance also because on average for each event we run 30-40 places are booked by our members who have joined the yearly membership. Early booking is truly and highly recommended. Last time we run an event at this venue we had a larger capacity and we sold out 5 days before the event date. The reason the events we organize are so successful is that we follow a very simple, but effective formula. A couple of days before the event we create a WhatsApp group with those attendees who wish to start getting to know each other . This allows each participant to set up meetings with those they wish to meet during (or even before) the event. On the day of the event, you will find a relaxed environment, and a welcoming and supportive crowd. Our team will be at the venue to introduce you to anybody specific you'd like to talk to. Guests will have access to the part of the Club reserved for our event, but not to other private areas of Hay Hill Club. You can book a private tour though. Dress code: business casual (no trainers, no jeans) Refund policy. Tickets bought in advance are generally cheaper than those bought on the day of the event and for this reason cannot be refunded. They can be reassigned to another person of your choice.",

At 6.30pm we will proceed with a talk from our guest speaker Mike Southon , the co-author of the book The Beermat Enterpreneur who will share some tips on how to turn a good idea into a great business. Mike co-founded The Instruction Set, a training and software business which grew from three to 150 people in five years and was then acquired by Cap Gemini Ernst and Young. He then worked on two start-ups which eventually both went public, and a number which didnt. Since the first publication of The Beermat Entrepreneur in 2002 he has spoken at over a thousand events all over the world and provided free, face-to-face mentoring to over 1,500 aspiring entrepreneurs. When hes not being The Beermat Entrepreneur at live events, Mike helps any type of company refine their elevator pitches, test their sales models and grow their sales. Mike is more than Quite Interesting. He spreads insight and cheerfulness in equal measure, like an ambidextrous chef icing two cakes at once.

        "summary": "Welcome to the Women Awakening Book Club! I wanted to bring together a group, a community of like-minded women who love to read, nurture their inner wisdom and celebrate the divine feminine that they are. By being open, curious is how we grow and expand. We will meet every 6-8 weeks in a London cafe, where we discuss a particular book. The range of books will focus on self-development, spirituality, women empowerment and ways we can relate this to our everyday world. Each session we will discuss and share our insights from the book and most importantly how these learnings can be embodied as we grow. I will guide the gathering, with key discussion points, however the main goal is for me to create space and allow the sharing of wisdom within the group. F or our next event in Nov we will discussing the book \"Sensual\" by Henika Patel. You can purchase the book at your local book store, online or see if you can borrow it at your local library. There will be a small fee for joining the gathering of 7. This will include a tea or coffee at the venue and an organisers fee. This ensures that we are supporting the venue and any costs that occur in supporting the book club, so we can continue to run this going forward. The fee is refundable if the cancellation occurs a week before the event. I recommend you RSVP in advance to book your space and leave you sufficient time to read the book. I will close the RSVP 1 day before the event, to allow sufficient time to finalise numbers for the venue. To make sure we keep an enjoyable, safe and non-judgemental space, here are the Book Club Rules:- Please RSVP on time and if something changes and you cant attend please let me know as soon as possible, so I can offer that place to someone else- Please arrive on time. We have so much to discuss so we want to maximise the time and explore as many insights as we can.- Please try to finish the book so you can contribute to the discussion. Sometimes we know life gets in the way, and if you havent completed the book, you can still attend and contribute as much as possible. - Allow a space for everyone to be heard. Please be respectful and open, even in times of disagreement. We want to avoid a space where there is interruption or certain members are dominating the conversation. - Given the nature of the topics, members may share very personal experiences or emotions. Please respect that this is a confidential space. Most of all have fun, grow, expand, allow us to connect with our inner wisdom as we sit in the company of some amazing women!",

We meet every 1st Thursday of the month between 10 am and 12 pm at the same venue. While you can book on the day, we ask that you purchase your ticket before you set off on your journey. This makes it much easier to check you in and get you to the coffee as soon as possible! How it works When you come to a Buzz youll be welcomed by the Buzz team, shown where the coffee is and introduced to some of the other attendees. Were here if you need further introductions to more guests, but youll find that everyone is really friendly and you can easily move around conversations to network as you like. The focus is open networking and easy-going conversations so that more business happens between our attendees easily. At roughly 11 am there is a short announcement section and youll find out who is in the room to help facilitate more connections.",

        "summary": "The Connections Club Practical, Professional & Profitable Networking Open to Business Owners, Influencers, and Leaders only, we understand the importance of networking in business. We focus on business excellence with quality businesses sharing best practices and learning with each other and from other experts, we bring in not on the networking circuit. Join our members to connect, build and maintain relationships The Connections Club is a structured and professional networking group which gives you the opportunity to connect with other business owners who are serious about growth, allows you to promote your own business and you take away a valuable skill, learning or insight - at every single meeting. Attendees are carefully selected to ensure that each meeting is filled with decision-makers and influencers - so you meet the right people to help you grow. Contact barbara@yourbusinessmatters.co to reserve your slot or to ask to be invoiced for the visitor meeting fee. Note we are not taking bookings for the following slots: IFA Slot, Commercial Insurance , Solicitors wills Trust & probate, Family Law or IP. Event Organiser Barbara Hodgson is the founder and chair. She has more than 10 years experience of connecting businesses through networking groups, conferences and one-off events - and is regarded highly by the numerous businesses she has connected. Quick to spot a potential partnership or a useful collaboration for her members, she ensures every meeting is practical, professional and useful for everyone who attends. Q & A Is The Connections Club right for you? Networking is only successful when the right people are introduced to each other, so we are selective about our members. We welcome business owners and influencers who have the ability to make decisions, who are committed to the growth of their business and who are just as interested in buying products and services as they are in selling their own. Is this you? If that sounds like you, The Connections Club may be the networking group youve been looking for. Who can attend? Attendees are all owners or decision-makers within a privately-owned business. (This is not a format that suits MLMs.) Male, female, start-ups and established businesses - all are welcome. What makes the Connections Club different? The objective is to make your networking profitable, not to profit from your networking. How is this done? Selective membership increases your chances of meeting the right people. The attendance of around 70 business owners gives you a large pool of contacts. The meeting format maximises the number of useful connections you make. You will eat, meet, learn and share at every meeting. The membership model attracts regular attendees who get to know you and your business and who are committed to helping you where possible Face-to-face Meeting format Our face-to-face meetings are informal networking followed by a seated lunch and a 60-second introduction from everyone at your table. There will then be an open session where you will hear from a speaker who may share business learnings or a skill, chair a debate or manage a discussion amongst the room. Whatever the topic, you will take away something that you can apply to your business. When will the group meet? The first Tuesday of the month, 11.45am - 2pm",

What are my transport and/or parking options at ExCeL? Parking is available on a first come, first served basis, using pay and display. If you are travelling to ExCeL London by road please use postcode E16 1XL. There are multiple ways of travelling to the venue:Elizabeth line (Custom House station)Underground and DLR (ExCeL can be accessed via two DLR stations: Custom House and Prince Regent)Cable car or Uber Boat are also options.For detailed directions click here and scroll downhttps://www.excel.london/visitor/getting-here Is the venue (ExCeL) disable friendly? Yes - all areas Where should I stay? If you plan on sightseeing you'll want to stay in central London, if your only attending the event you'll want to stay close. Hotel rooms and AirBnB's are limited due to all the other events in town over the weekend. We strongly encourage you to book a room now with free cancellation. There are two Premier Inn's and a Travelodge near by. How much are tickets? All tickets available on PayPal - PayPal will be used to process payments and an account isn't required. Unfortunately due to high conversion fees all tickets will be sold in US dollars, spreading the expense helps us keep ticket prices down as low as possible Early Entry Tickets: $135 ($42.09 increase) + conversion & PayPal fees General Admission: $85 ($21.13 increase) + conversion & PayPal fees Meet & Greet: $20 ($7 increase) + conversion & PayPal fees **** IMPORTANT INFO : Due to the surcharge between Eventbrite and PayPal in addition the conversion fee between GBP and USD we no longer charge in local currency. All transactions for all sales will be in USD$. I apologize for the inconvenience. The amount of money we were losing to fees overall and to get the funds converted to USD at a lower merchant rate in order to pay bills in the UK was astronomical. **** Will there be a limit on the number of tickets I can buy? Yes, only two (2) tickets per transaction for Early Entry tickets and four (2) per transaction for General Admission. What is included with each ticket? ALL signing tickets include entrance, pictures and autographs with authors. There is no separate cost for pictures or autographs (this is NOT a con or book fair). One ticket= all day access. The only difference is that Early Entry tickets give an additional 2 hours to meet authors , get books signed/take photos etc. Who must be ticketed? Anyone entering the Exhibition halls and/or Foyer must be ticketed. All spouses, caregivers, friends, parents, and children over the age of 16 must be ticketed. No children under 16 permitted, no exceptions Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event? RARE is now able to scan tickets for entry, so paper or electronic tickets are both accepted.If you do not have your paper ticket or can not check in electronically then identification is required. If you do not have a paper ticket, can not check in electronically, and your identification is not the same name as you purchased your ticket in, you will need to update the correct information on Eventbrite prior to the event. I s there an age restriction for the event: No one under 16 will be permitted into the event. All attendees between the age of 16 and 17 must be accompanied by a ticketed adult. Please note there will be explicit book covers and banners in the event room. *Due to occupancy restrictions CHILDREN UNDER 16 will not be permitted entry* Do I need to add personal information to all tickets being purchased? Yes. The ticket holder's name, email address , age and country should be on each ticket. Prior to paying for your tickets you will be prompted to enter the name, email, and age for each attendee. **DUE TO THE NUMBER OF TICKETS SOLD WE WILL NOT MAKE NAME CHANGES FOR YOU** Should you sell your ticket this is between you and the buyer, you must change the names AND email address on all tickets. Is my ticket transferrable? Should you sell any tickets it will be your responsibility to transfer the ticket to the new owner by updating the name, age, country and email address for each attendee. Can I update my ticket information? Yes, log into your Eventbrite account and update your information there. Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event? No! You can also present your electronic ticket and QR code on your phone.Please bring one of the following with you to enter: paper ticket, electronic ticket, or identification that matches the name on the purchased ticket. Identification is required for those who look under 17 if not accompanied by an adult 18 and over. Or if you do not have a paper ticket or a way to electronically check in, and said identification must match the name on the ticket. The name on the ticket doesn't match the attendee. Is that okay? Tickets should match your identification so we can verify the age of each attendee and purchaser if ticket is lost or you are not able to check in electronically. For a smooth entry, try to make sure if possible that your name on your identification and your ticket match. Please keep in mind if your friend buys your ticket and her name is on it you have no recourse. Is there a limit of how many items I can get signed by one author or in total at the event? No more than 2 non book items (including book plates) per each author. No more than one special edition per title; for example if an author has 3 special editions each has a different title then you can purchase a total of 3, one of each plus any back list titles. No limits on non special editions unless otherwise noted Some authors will have a limit of total number of items to be signed. This information will be posted as soon as possible and is subject to change at any time. What can/can't I bring to the event?

Only traditionally published books in the UK will be available through a bookseller at the event. **WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO BRING YOUR BOOKS WITH YOU TO THE EVENT*** Avoid having a broken heart should your favorite author sell out of books or the book retailer didn't bring that title. Will a bookseller (bookstore) be selling books at the event? Yes however a book seller will only sell traditional titles -meaning only titles distributed by a UK publisher. If the book you want is not traditionally published (the author is indie) then the bookseller will not have the book. Will there be food or drink for sale at the event?

No. You will be on your feet all day and rooms tend to get warm, please dress comfortably, wear comfortable shoes, and dress in layers. Will the author list change? Yes. The author list is subject to change at any time. Ticket sales are final regardless of cancellations. Authors take signings very serious and confirm after much thought. RARE re confirms with each author three - four times prior to being announced. Should they cancel it is due to a conflict in schedule, an illness, or emergency. Please be prepared for cancellations, they are inevitable especially for overseas signings. What is the refund policy? **ALL SALES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUNDS REGARDLESS OF REASON** Where can I contact the organizer with any questions? Contact Team RARE at the following email address: rarettes@gmail.com Where can I find more info about the event and get in touch with fellow readers?

Feel free to volunteer if you want to be with people **READ AS MANY ATTENDING AUTHORS AS POSSIBLE - Why? Should your authors cancel you'll have new to you unicorn's/fave authors to see.

HOWEVER the author line up can change at any time. Cancellations will happen, they are inevitable. Schedules change, illness occurs, emergencies happen, life changes.

Author lunches/breaks: The room does not close for lunch however each section will leave for lunch.

        "summary": "In recent years, large-scale digitisation of early modern periodicals has revolutionised the searchability of collections of ephemeral print culture. Enabled by optical character recognition technology, this shift has transformed the way scholars use databases of primary material, introducing new quantitative approaches to these vast collections. However, this shift also poses epistemological questions within new digital humanities frameworks. The paper will explore this shift by presenting material newly discovered by these methods relating to church building in London in the first half of the eighteenth century. Firstly, looking at the way that the work of the New Churches Commission was represented and debated by the politically factional newspaper culture in the first years of Hanoverian rule, and then recognising the effect this discourse may have had in shaping the way that people experienced the city. By incorporating periodical culture as an important context of the work of the Commission, for the first time this study proposes a substantive media and reception history of these iconic buildings of the English Baroque. Furthermore, this paper will consider the explosion of architectural publishing in the periodical press of the mid-1730s, in the context of James Ralphs Critical Review , examining the way that architectural practitioners such as John James were increasingly forced to foray into periodical culture to defend their expertise and reputations. These events will be read towards the political and social meanings of church building and church restoration, and the growing anxiety about the need to disambiguate the meanings of the built environment to the urban public in an age of print culture. Speaker bio: Matthew Lloyd Roberts is a history of art PhD candidate at Downing College, Cambridge and member of the Ax:son Johnson Centre for the Study of Classical Architecture. His PhD research is concerned with the cultural reception of the changing built environment of England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. He studied ancient and modern history at Keble College, Oxford and has an MA in architectural history from the Bartlett, UCL. Complementing his academic work, he is also interested in disseminating academic research to broader audiences and produces and hosts two podcasts concerned with architectural history and culture, the independent About Buildings and Cities and the official podcast of the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain. His architectural criticism has also appeared in Tribune (magazine), New Statesman and the Critic and he leads architectural walking tours for a variety of organisations including Open City.

        "summary": "Prevention is a fundamental component of ending violence against women and girls (VAWG) and a vital priority for EVAW alongside our work to end online abuse. For our second annual prevention conference, we will be exploring the impact the online world is having on young people, and what can be done to mitigate it. We will hear from a range of exciting speakers who are making strides to improve prevention of VAWG amongst young people, ranging from frontline practitioners to academic researchers, all with the shared interest in improving education on misogynistic attitudes and behaviour. Our first panel will address the impact of misogyny online on young people, and the rise of the manosphere. We will be hearing from: Laura Bates, writer and founder of Everyday Sexism Project Hope Not Hate, an advocacy group that campaigns against racism and fascism School of Sexuality Education, an organisation that delivers workshops in schools on consent, sexual health, porn and positive relationships. Our second morning panel will explore the impact of pornography on young people, and we will be joined by: NSPCC, a children's charity that combats abuse and supports children and families Glitch, a charity ending online abuse and championing digital citizenship Professor Jessica Ringrose, an expert in youth digital cultures and tech facilitated violence and abuse. The afternoon workshop will be hosted by Internet Matters , and will explore the importance of media literacy in the digital age, and how we can educate young people to combat the rise of online misogyny. During the event, we will also have an opportunity to listen to members of EVAWs Prevention Network - discussing challenges and celebrating successes of the past year, and looking to the year ahead including opportunities for joint work and solidarity. The conference will be a fantastic opportunity to bring voices together and generate discussions about the role prevention must play to address the misogyny that underpins violence against women and girls. This will be a hybrid event. In-person places are limited but we strongly encourage those who can to attend in-person for networking with other sector colleagues.

Marking International Men's Day, the objective of our event is to give men both the reason and the skills to lean into the conversation, while also providing women and non-binary people with the confidence to engage more men in inclusion and diversity. Because ultimately we can only make real change by working together. Date: Tue Nov 19 2024 Time: 13:00:00 GMT Location: Conway Hall, 25 Red Lion Square, London, WC1R 4RL Our speakers will share their insights and experiences, shedding light on the evolving dynamics of masculinity in diverse work environments. You'll have the chance to ask questions, participate in interactive sessions, and network with like-minded professionals. The theme for this year is 'Leading with Heart'. The rapid development of AI is making it more pressing than ever to differentiate ourselves for our leadership and for our careers. Equally the world seems more polarised than ever before with many people leading from hurt. In the face of this, skills previously thought of as 'soft' skills (and as such potentially disregarded by many), e.g. empathy, compassion, connection and vulnerability, will become the core skills needed for leadership in the future.

This event promises to be one of our most engaging conferences yet, featuring interactive training sessions , a keynote address from the esteemed Professor Dame Carol Black , and our highly anticipated Annual Awards Ceremony . Event Highlights Date: 14th November Location: Broadway House, Westminster, London, SW1H 9NQ Agenda at a Glance 10.30AM: Arrival and Registration Enjoy coffee and pastries while you network with like-minded professionals and leaders in the field. 11AM: Welcoming Address Join our Chair Dr Julie Denning for the welcoming address and preparation for the day 11.15AM: Interactive Training Session with Professor Nancy Doyle Its been a while since neurodiversity hit the radar of the diversity and inclusion sector and most people have heard of it, and know some affected. As a result, theres a surge of diagnoses and disclosures at work and a difficulty in meeting the need. This talk will discuss the latest research based evidence on what works, whats missing, and how we scale. Well cover: Evidence to support disability adjustments Latest case law on whats reasonable The limits of adjustments tick lists Career progression and talent Scaling neurodiversity support Universal design Presenter: Nancy Doyle is a Chartered Psychologist, HCPC registered and a Visiting Professor of Occupational Psychology, co-directing the Centre for Neurodiversity at Work at Birkbeck, University of London. Her BBC documentary Employable Me helped Neurodiversity hit the mainstream in 2016 and 2016, and she founded one of the worlds leading Neurodiversity consultancies, the non-profit b-Corp, Genius Within.

As well, Nancy has managed a large, majority neurodivergent staff team for over ten years and has lived experience of making it work in practice. 12.15PM: Interactive Training Session with Professor Sarah Vickerstaff Managing health issues at work: Are we ready for the older workforce? The relationship between health and work is increasingly significant in the context of an ageing population who are expected to extend their working lives. Research suggests that responding to the health issues that older workers may face requires not simply a focus on managing diagnosed health conditions and returns to work but also more proactive health promotion activities and creating an age positive environment. Offering a more age positive organisational climate encourages more openness about health and is likely to be a more supportive and productive environment for older workers and everyone else. The role of occupational health and wellbeing initiatives in this field is an under researched area but a very important one given the policy drift to encourage people to work for longer and delay retirement. This presentation assesses what we know currently and what we need to know to improve the management of older workers. 1.15PM: LUNCH 2.15 Welcome back and Celebration of VRA - Julie Denning (VRA Chair) 2.35 IRCM Partnership - Carole Chantler 2:45 PM: Keynote Speech by Professor Dame Carol Black Topic: Work and health, acknowledging 30years of VRA Renowned for her extensive research and leadership in public health and work environments, Professor Dame Carol Black will share her insights on how to create healthier workplaces and more engaged teams.

        "summary": "What are the fundamentals needed to build an inclusive workplace for women in STEM? Join WISE as we explore how to develop an inclusive environment for women to thrive at work, ultimately enabling businesses to move the dial on gender parity in STEM. WISE and expert speakers from the EDI field will explore four key areas that directly contribute to this goal: Allyship, Progression, Leadership and Programmes. These will be examined from both an individual and organisational perspective throughout the day. As a thought leader in the EDI space, WISE is distinctly positioned to deliver this inspiring and informative conference, which will provide practical takeaways and inform tangible actions for you to take away. The Morning Plenary The morning plenary will highlight the EDI building blocks required to be an inclusive employer and future-proof your business. Our flagship WISE Ten Steps framework has undergone some exciting changes - be one of the first to learn about whats new and how the updated framework can help your business prioritise the participation, retention and progression of women in the workplace. Ola Gwozdz is a data philosopher, an award-winning researcher and IoT innovation specialist with over a decade of experience in technology adoption in major projects (Olympics, CrossRail, Tideway, HS2). Ola has been appointed this years UN Women UK Delegate to the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW68) as well as the Lead of Digital Women Programme at Arup. She has an MSc in Innovation, Leadership and Management, and in her current doctoral research she is investigating not one but three big topics - Digital, Inclusivity and Sustainability in the emerging context of global polycrisis. The latest UN report warns that at the current rate of progress in will take up to 286 years to close the inequality gap. Why does it matter in a context of digital? Because this gap directly translates to the effectiveness of our technologies, many of which are built upon discriminatory and unequal systems and frameworks. How can a relational approach to digital, inclusivity and sustainability unlock new potentials and capabilities, and form a blueprint for 21st century organisational management and leadership? Ola will join the morning panel discussion along with other experts in the diversity and inclusion field to discuss the opportunities organisations can create to build an inclusive future for women in STEM. The Afternoon Plenary The afternoon plenary aims to inspire STEM professionals into action by offering clear take-aways and tips to enable individuals to be more inclusive in the workplace. Kate Bellingham has had what is best described as a portfolio career. Currently a Doctoral Researcher at UCLs Centre for Engineering Education, Kate has championed STEM opportunities throughout four decades as an Engineer, Broadcaster, Educator and Consultant. In her keynote presentation, Kate will be reflecting on developments during her own decades working to promote opportunities for women in STEM while offering her personal thoughts on possible new approaches and the value of keeping a growth mindset. By sharing insights from her ongoing doctoral research into the underrepresentation of women on undergraduate engineering programmes, she will highlight opportunities to see things from different angles while giving an update on new developments in research into gender and STEM. Kate will take part in the afternoon panel discussion along with other experts to discuss the role individuals can play in building an inclusive workplace for women in STEM. Learning and Innovation Sessions Eight development breakout sessions will delve deeper into the four key topics of focus; Allyship, Progression, Leadership and Programmes. These will be examined from both an individual and organisational perspective throughout the day, giving both organisations and individuals tips and skills on how to build an inclusive workplace for women in STEM. The Ideas Exhibition The ideas exhibition in the Riverside Room will run throughout the event and give opportunities to network, share challenges and solutions to EDI issues and forge new connections with likeminded professionals from the STEM arena. Interactive Discussion The event will provide lots of opportunities for you to share your thoughts and pose questions to experts with the know-how via interactive discussions throughout the day.

        "summary": "The Centre for Progressive Policy invites you to attend our annual Inclusive Growth Conference at the Royal Society in London, hosted by Labour Peer, broadcaster and political commentator, Baroness Ayesha Hazarika MBE Delivering higher economic growth in every part of the country is one of the new governments defining missions. Keir Starmer and his Cabinet want to fix the foundations to deliver a decade of national renewal - and have made clear that growing the economy is a prerequisite to much of the change they would like to enact. But is Labour prepared to deliver the step-change in our economic model that is needed to deliver sustained higher growth in all corners of the UK during this parliament? Will ambitious agendas on workers rights, devolution, and the transition to net-zero be matched with bold action on public health and childcare? Will the first Labour Budget in 14 years demonstrate a level of ambition on public investment that matches its rhetoric or will short-term notions of fiscal credibility prevail? Can the government deliver tangible improvements to the people and places most excluded from prosperity, in such a way that can stem the tide of populism? As the leading think tank focused on inclusive economic growth, the Centre for Progressive Pol icy believes Labours mission is the right one. But our years of research and policy on inclusive growth demonstrate the scale of ambition needed. Join us as we bring together leading economic and political voices to explore how the Labour government can deliver its critical mission for growth. This years conference sessions will explore: Whose growth is it anyway? Handing power away to deliver prosperity to every community Raising public investment National renewal for political survival: how can Labour win again? Agenda A summary agenda is included below.

        "summary": "Our Pharma Supply Chain & Security World Summit is back in London for the 6th time, and this time with more focus on optimizing your supply chain challenges to ensure an agile, responsive, streamlined and secured supply chain. The pharmaceutical supply chains are facing a significant challenge in the form of counterfeit drugs that are entering the supply chain from various points at different levels. Pharmaceutical companies that adopt an effective serialisation program have end-to-end visibility and traceability for all of their packaging, labelling, and distribution. This enables them to rapidly identify and quarantine counterfeit products. This helps to protect patients, consumers worldwide, brand equity, reputations and the company's revenue stream by ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements for serialisation of medicines in emerging markets. The rise of the digital supply chain has been accompanied by an ever-increasing number of regulations that have accelerated its development and adoption. Years ago, the pharmaceutical supply chain regulated only manufacturing and distribution. However, with a rise in economic impact of counterfeit drugs on society, there have been attempts to improve serialisation processes even further. It gives us great pleasure to welcome you to the Pharma Supply Chain & Security World 2025 .",

        "summary": "The evidence is clear that developing a culture where staff can flourish, underpinned by leadership that is compassionate , inclusive and collaborative, is crucial both to the physical and mental health of staff, and to the health and care systems ability to deliver high-quality care. But what stops leaders and systems from developing and sustaining such cultures and from tackling the bullying and discrimination that continue to harm staff and impact the care they can offer? How do we transform our workplaces to properly support those who choose to work in health and care, so that staff are not just surviving their day jobs but are truly able to thrive and grow? This event will explore what is needed to ensure people and leaders are better enabled, encouraged in their professional development, and consistently supported to deliver and support the three fundamental shifts outlined by the Prime Minister in a recent speech at The Kings Fund : a move from analogue to digital, from hospitals to communities, and from sickness to prevention. Conference sessions will delve into how to achieve greater equity in the workplace to ensure the health and care system provides genuinely inclusive places to work, fostering belonging and supporting staff wellbeing and development. We will examine the role of those working and leading in health and care, as well as patient and community leaders, in making this happen, and how old power (held by a few, closely guarded and inaccessible) is colliding with new power (enabled by people with agency at a grassroots level), the tension this creates, and how to work effectively with both types of power. Sessions will also examine: how we can enable love and satisfaction to be the focus in our work, acting quickly and consistently to make the health and care sector a more attractive place to work what it means to lead with compassion, empower staff and create agency creating inclusive organisations and cultures that are fair and just for everyone who works in them zombie leadership: burying the ideas that just wont die developing radical approaches to organisational development harnessing the power of the voluntary, community, and social enterprise (VCSE) sector the changing role of strategic clinical leaders. Please join us and your peers as we explore how to move beyond survival and create a resilient, thriving future together. Our aim is to create a learning community on the day where you will have the opportunity to learn and to share your leadership and workforce experiences and ideas. Collaborate with experts and leaders from across the health and care system through interactive workshops, panel debates and keynote talks. FAQs Can I pay by invoice? Yes.

        "summary": "Speaker Dr Lise Jaillant Reader (Associate Professor) in Digital Cultural Heritage at Loughborough University; Visiting Fellow, Wolfson College, University of Cambridge; Cambridge Digital Humanities Associate Lise has a background in publishing history and digital humanities. She is an expert on born-digital archives and the issues of preservation and access to these archives. Since 2020, she has been UK PI for four AHRC-funded projects on Archives and Artificial Intelligence. These international projects aim to make digitised and born-digital archives more accessible to researchers, and to use innovative research methods such as AI to analyse archival data. Lise enjoys working across sectors and disciplines. As a digital humanist, she has extensive experience of collaborating with computer scientists, archivists, librarians, and government professionals to unlock digital archival data with innovative technologies. Abstract This talk presents ground-breaking new work on AI applied to the government records of the Cabinet Office, in order to automatically identify historically significant records to preserve and other records that can be deleted. The Cabinet Office is the UK central government department that supports the Prime Minister in the effective running of government. Its records are among the most important that are deposited in The National Archives, covering those of the Prime Minister, Cabinet proceedings, government efficiency and reform, and the formulation of legislation, among other areas. This talk, which is based on a co-authored article with David Canning (Cabinet Office), does not only describe a radically new methodology to appraise digital records, it also makes a significant theoretical contribution to academic disciplines that seldom talk to each other including archival studies, digital humanities and computer/data science. It proposes a new archival mindset that reflects the digital realities faced by records managers, archivists and users. This theoretical approach combines distant viewing (necessary to approach huge amounts of records) and close reading of a selection of records (to ensure the effectiveness of computational approaches). This combination of distant and close is an answer to the need to move away from paper minds, and embrace digital archival realities and methodologies. The conclusion explores where records management might go next in deploying Artificial Intelligence technologies and the benefits these may have in opening up archives for future historians. Recommendations are offered to facilitate the ethical application of AI to records and archives, in the government sector and beyond.

        "summary": "Join the African Leadership Organization at the UK-Africa Partnerships Forum on the 21st of November 2024 at the House of Lords, UK . The forum will bring together top policymakers, industry leaders, and visionaries from across the UK and Africa to explore and harness the continent's burgeoning potential. The UK has maintained a long-standing relationship with Africa, historically focused on trade, investment, and development aid. However, the UK's exit from the European Union has prompted a rethinking of its foreign economic policies, particularly toward Africaa continent poised for significant economic growth. In 2023, Africa was seen as one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, with a collective GDP of over $3 trillion. Despite global economic challenges, Sub-Saharan Africa's economy grew by an estimated 3.6% in 2023, with projections to reach around 4.1% by 2024 due to robust performance in key sectors like agriculture, energy, and telecommunications. The UK has responded by recalibrating its relationships through bilateral agreements. In 2021, the UK signed Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with countries like Kenya, Ghana, and the Southern African Customs Union, ensuring continuity in trade post-Brexit. By 2023, UK-Africa trade was valued at approximately 40 billion, with major exports including machinery, pharmaceuticals, and financial services. However, there is untapped potential to expand trade beyond traditional sectors and drive innovation-led growth across both economies. Though trade between the UK and Africa continues to grow, there is still significant room for expansion. Relatedly, Africa accounts for about 2.5% of total UK exports, and UK Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Africa reached 50 billion by 2023, largely concentrated in extractive industries, financial services, and infrastructure. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into effect in 2021, and covers 54 African nations with a combined market of over 1.3 billion people, represents a transformative opportunity for UK businesses to access new markets and diversify trade relationships. In 2023, the AfCFTA's potential to boost intra-African trade by 52.3% by 2025 and increase trade with external partners like the UK presents enormous opportunities for collaboration. However, Africa still faces significant challenges in infrastructure development, trade facilitation, and financial inclusion, areas where UK expertise could play a pivotal role. One of the main challenges to expanding UK-Africa partnerships is the need for better policy alignment and regulatory cooperation. Africas regulatory landscape is complex, with varying rules on investment, trade, and digital services across the continent. The UK, through its Department for International Trade and Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), has been working on developing more harmonized trade and investment frameworks with African governments. The UK-Africa Partnership Forum would therefore create a platform for advancing mutual interests and unlocking new opportunities in trade, innovation, and sustainable development. The event will build upon the strong foundation of existing trade, investment, and development relationships between the UK and Africa, reinforcing established partnerships while identifying areas for expansion and deepening engagement, facilitating discussions and interactions that uncover and develop new avenues for collaboration, as well as influence the future trajectory of UK-Africa relations through high-level dialogue and strategic partnerships, ensuring that both regions benefit from shared prosperity and development. Key Highlights of the Forum 1) Keynote Addresses & High-Level Thematic Panel Discussions 2) Bilateral Meetings, Policy Alignment Discussions & Exclusive Networking Sessions 3) Workshops and Breakout Sessions 4) Exhibition and Showcase (Countries and States Governments Investment Showcase) 5) Unveiling of the African Leadership Magazines special publications",

The tightly packed core of ancient colleges, the picturesque riverside 'Backs' (college gardens) and the leafy green meadows surrounding the city give it a more tranquil appeal than its historic rival Oxford. Like 'the Other Place', as Oxford is known locally, the buildings here seem unchanged for centuries, and it's possible to wander around the college buildings and experience them as countless prime ministers, poets, writers and scientists have done. Sheer academic achievement seems to permeate the very walls: cyclists loaded down with books negotiate cobbled passageways, students relax on manicured lawns and great minds debate life-changing research in historic pubs. First-time punters zigzag erratically across the river, and those long past their student days wonder what it would have been like to study in such splendid surroundings.

This is an in-person event, Thursday 28 November 1 - 2 pm, CLC 1.09 (Clerici Building), Headington campus. There is a significant body of work that considers the role of the regions and regionality in the British film and television industry, seen most visibly in Lez Cooke's A Sense of Place: Regional British Television Drama, 1956-82 (2012). The recent devolution of Channel 4, and then the BBC, combined with the investment and growth of areas like MediaCityUK in Salford, Digbeth Loc. Studios in Birmingham, and The Depot in Liverpool, has rekindled interest in the role of the regions in the future of Britains screen economy. However, aside from a few notable exceptions, this work has consistently foregrounded the contribution of larger metropolitan areas, leaving the contribution of smaller city regions underexplored. Without the critical mass and infrastructure of larger city regions, smaller economic areas face a significant disadvantage in fulfilling their potential as locations for the production of film and television content, but that does not mean that attempts are not being made to capitalise on the economic and cultural benefits that a thriving film industry could bring. Taking three regions not typically represented in any discussion of a national film industry, this paper seeks to explore what opportunities exist for places characterised as left behind - areas blighted by what David Etherington, Martin Jones, and Luke Telford termed a structural cocktail of disadvantage including low paid jobs, welfare erosion, indebtedness, destitution, and food insecurity (2022). Taking Sunderland, Stoke-on-Trent and Southampton as its focus, this paper will offer a snapshot of the different strategies that are being employed in three very different regions and will consider their effectiveness against the backdrop of national initiatives like the outgoing governments Levelling Up agenda. Biography : Dr Mark McKenna is an Associate Professor in Film and Media Industries at Staffordshire University. His research is interested in marketing and branding, censorship and regulation, and media labour, and his work has explored these ideas from a range of different perspectives. He is the author of Nasty Business: The Marketing and Distribution of the Video Nasties (EUP, 2020), Snuff (LUP, 2023), and Big Wednesday: Lamenting Lost Youth in the New Hollywood (Routledge, 2024) . He is the co-editor of Horror Franchise Cinema (Routledge, 2021), Stars and Franchises: Identity, Image and Intellectual Property (EUP, 2024) and Screening Controversial Cinema (forthcoming, Routledge, 2025), and the author of the report Silicon Stoke - Developing Film TV and Other Content Production in North Staffordshire , which explored the opportunities that are available locally for stimulating the growth of the screen industries set against the backdrop of the governments levelling-up agenda. This work forms the foundation of McKennas fourth monograph Levelling Up the Screen Industries: Film and Television Production as Regenerative Strategy in Places Left Behind (forthcoming, Routledge)",

A language for exploring and discussing organisational issues issues that aren't only process-related Found the ideas of context and awareness tied well into managing different relationships This rounds out organisational change aspects any serious practitioner should know Really related to Organising at Human Scale; Energised by the mapping exercises before and after it Previously known as \"Leading in a Transforming Organisation\" and run in London, Berlin, Melbourne, Manchester, this is three modules of Leading with Outcomes as an integrated, workshop-style training experience: Day 1. Leading with Outcomes: Foundation Day 2. Adaptive Organisation (I): Business agility at every scale Day 3. Adaptive Organisation (II): Between spaces, scopes, and scales We'll be exploring what it means to lead in an organisation where change is happening wherever it's needed, at the pace it's needed, and engaging the people who are needed everyone whose energy, insights, and innovations you'll need. On day 1 (Foundation) we look at how to develop and pursue strategy in the language of outcomes, introducing some key conversational and organisational patterns and tools. You'll be developing skills you can not only bring to set-piece strategy events such as reviews and workshops but apply in everyday settings too. On days 2 and 3 (Adaptive Organisation parts I and II), we will be exercising those skills further as we get to grips with a classic and powerful model of organisation that we've made accessible and brought up to date, applicable to organisations of all shapes and sizes. For any given organisational scale (day 2), what are the preconditions for business agility, and what gets in the way of that? Similarly, in what practical ways can we help the relationships between organisational scales (day 3) to be more healthy and productive? You'll be learning some of the deep magic of organising how to understand it in terms of relationships and constraints and you won't look at organisations in quite the same way again! Audience You can approach Leading in a Transforming Organisation in complementary ways: As a workshop, an opportunity to explore how your organisation (or your client organisation) works and how you might influence that As leadership development, participants invited for their growth potential As technical training, participants attending out of interest in the models covered Per the final section below, as a near-alternative to Leading with Outcomes: Train-the-Trainer / Facilitator If any of those speak to you, you're invited!

Since 2011, jihadist insurgencies driven by al-Qaida and IS-affiliated groups have progressively engulfed Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. As of 2024, the region has become the worlds new epicentre of jihadist activity, accounting for over half of all deaths from terrorism worldwide. The Sahel is also home to the worlds most neglected humanitarian crises, with over two million internally displaced persons in Burkina Faso alone and thousands killed across the region every year. Capitalising on popular discontent, military juntas have seized and consolidated power in recent years, violently cracking down on dissent and instrumentalising regional and international alliances. Meanwhile, the region has become an unexpected arena of geopolitical competition between global powers vying for influence. As the juntas have distanced themselves from long standing allies such as France and the U.S., Russia has cemented its sway and the presence of its paramilitary forces. After years of worsening violence and political upheaval, the Sahel is now facing a turning point. Jihadist groups are inching ever closer to the regions capitals, violence continues to spiral, and struggling Sahelian juntas face an uncertain future while Moscows shadow continues to loom over the region. *photo credit Finbarr O'Reilly",

Taking a trauma-informed, anti-oppressive approach, the guide shares and celebrates methods of fostering cultures of safety and care for young people that have been effective.

        "summary": "In this event, Professor Sufian Jusoh will speak about the ASEANs role in fostering unity and solidarity among its member states during geo-economic challenges. The Leaders of ASEAN during the 42nd and 43rd ASEAN Summits in Indonesia in 2023 agreed to work towards an ASEAN Vision 2045, which will replace the current ASEAN Vision 2025: Forging Ahead Together. The ASEAN Vision 2045 is set to shape the destiny of the ASEAN region, which is one of the most economically dynamic economic regions and predicted to collectively be the 4th largest economy in the world. ASEAN faces a lot of challenges and uncertainties in moving towards the next phase of regional integration. Firstly, ASEAN needs to foster unity and solidarity among its member states in facing the regional and global geo-economic challenges. ASEAN has to be able to address the elephants in the room, i.e. the uncertainty in Myanmar, and the more assertive China in its own backyards. ASEAN Member States have also not been able to specifically find common grounds on other conflicts such as in the Middle-East and the Russia-Ukraine, what more with Taiwan facing a much greater threat from China. Secondly, ASEAN will have to address the inclusive growth and economic disparity among its own member states, including Timor-Leste. The economic disparity is further exacerbated by issues like climate change; rapid technology changes where most ASEAN Member States are technology adopters instead of technology frontrunners; competition for resources such as critical minerals, renewable energy, and food security and the uncertain global and regional financial landscape. Finally, ASEAN may have to play an important role in the re-globalisation, where ASEAN as a region plays an important role in re-igniting the multilateral trading system, whilst continuing addressing the regional trade and investment priorities like the full and effective implementation of the RCEP. Most importantly, ASEAN Vision 2045 will be the catalyst for regional and global economic growth, setting the pace for peace, stability and prosperity in this region. This event is being run in collaboration with Malay World Studies, St Catharines College, and will be followed by a drinks reception. Malay World studies events | St Catharines College, Cambridge About the speaker: Professor Sufian Jusoh is the Director and Professor of International Trade and Investment at the Institute of Malaysia and International Studies, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

In APEC, Sufian played a key role in the success of Malaysias chairmanship of APEC 2020, leading to the APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040, Malaysian representative to the preparation of the APEC Food Security Roadmap 2030, and a delegate to the APEC Investment Expert Group.

This will include providing DDP interventions with the children, building therapeutic alliance with the parents, and also how DDP informed parenting support can help the caregivers to emotionally connect with their children in ways which increase feelings of safety and security. We will explore the impact of developmental trauma on the children and families and consider what is needed to help the children recover and thrive. We will consider the principles central to DDP interventions and how these can inform the support we offer. Central to these will be cultivating the attitude of PACE (playfulness, acceptance, curiosity, and empathy). This exploration will include reflecting on cultural variations in the attitude of PACE and working with families from cultures different to our own. This will provide us with models for DDP in therapy, in parenting and as parenting support in the moment. Objectives and outcomes from the course The learning objectives of the Seminar are: Explore the impact of developmental trauma on the children and families.

        "summary": "Please do consider a donation - all kindnesses, small or large, go a long way in helping us deliver our nature outreach programme. The presentation of contemporary art in natural history collections is a distinct field of curatorial practice that also has a recent art and exhibition history. The opportunities that this work presents for museums and audiences alike are manifold, but it is not without challenges. This lecture discusses the production and display of contemporary art in natural history collections across a range of institutions and examines the ways this work has addressed ecological concerns such as species and habitat loss. At a time when museums across the sector are declaring a climate emergency and developing ways to respond, Dr Sarah Wade suggests that this artistic and curatorial work provides productive ways to activate collections, engage audiences and offer new possibilities for thinking through human-wildlife relations in ecologically troubled times. Dr Sarah Wade is Associate Professor in Museum Studies at University of East Anglia. She has published widely on extinction and wildlife conservation issues in artistic and curatorial practice. She also co-founded the Curating the Sea research project, resulting in a special issue of the Journal of Curatorial Studies (2020) and Oceans: Documents of Contemporary Art (MIT Press/Whitechapel Gallery, 2023). Sarah has worked with various museums and heritage organisations and continues to collaborate with museum colleagues on research, exhibitions and public engagement events. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lead Image: Installation view of Sonia Levy: For the Love of Corals, Obsidian Coast, 2018 .

It is home to world-class collaborative research within state-of-the-art facilities. At this event you will have the opportunity to engage with our dynamic team and discover how you can leverage their expertise to power agri-tech innovation and adoption. Connect with fellow members and build your network, exchange ideas and foster new collaborations to support your agri-tech ambitions. At the UK Agri-Tech Centre we can provide a range of spectral imaging facilities and services from controlled environment automated systems through to farm scale remote sensing. We will showcase some of these systems and discuss how they are important tools for agri-tech product development, especially for AI-based tools. The following items will be on display: Solar-Induced Fluorescence Imaging System: A unique capability, this is an imaging solar-induced fluorescence sensor mounted on a drone platform. This is a compelling alternative to light aircraft or satellite-based deployments and offers a higher spatial resolution and greater deployment flexibility. Ideal for development of disease detection systems. HySpex Mjolnir Hyperspectral sensor: Drone mounted hyperspectral system operating from 400 2500 nm. Useful for a range of developments including disease detection, nutrient mapping and yield forecasting. There will also be an opportunity to view the Plant Phenotyping and Soil Health Facility which demonstrates the cross-rotational, multi-seasonal context from tillage operations, through drilling, plant establishment and crop development, to harvest and post-harvest. This is the world's first glasshouse designed to study plant-soil-water relationships at pilot scale under a multi-sensor phenotyping gantry. This event is open to all - research organisations, agri-businesses, farmers and agronomists - to explore how soil management can impact soil and crop health and protection. This event is free to attend, and will include lunch and refreshments.",

        "summary": "Convenors: Andrew Moeller (Faculty of History); Alberto Giubilini (Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics) With the rapid development of AI and biotechnologies come vast powers to reshape ourselves and the natural world. Whether it is about human-animal chimeras, CRISPR-CAS9, mass automation, or brain-computer interfaces, there exists an urgent need for broad societal discussions to help chart a responsible path forward. As technological advances grant us new powers, so do they blur some boundaries between humans, animals, and machines, prodding us to ask the question: what does it mean to be human? The Biotechnologies, Artificial Intelligence, and Human Identity Conference brings together scholars from across disciplines to assess the right uses of AI and biotechnologies. In the medical and healthcare context, these technologies have the potential to help persons with a wide range of physical disabilities. It is likely that medicine and healthcare will be among the first fields of application of such technologies. But some suggest their use can be extended well beyond therapeutic interventions. Through these technologies, the boundaries between therapies and enhancement become blurred and the power to alter fundamental aspects of human nature and human relationships is increased. For instance, we could potentially control the emotions or physical actions of another person via an implant in our brain and in their own. Or control the pleasure centres in our own brains. It may not also be clear who has primary agency when it comes to a particular act or decision. We might be able to heighten our own alertness and awareness and increase other capacities. And so on. With the potential for what some might consider the misuse of these technologies, how do they challenge traditional views on human nature? And conversely, how proposed, shared aspects of our humanity ought to shape personal, societal, and governmental positions on the right uses of biotechnologies and AI? By considering what it means to be human, we believe we can foster more substantial and productive debates and encourage broader societal involvement in these debates. These are matters for the whole human family, as they relate to our very nature as human beings, as well as our place within the natural order.
